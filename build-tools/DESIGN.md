## The published shrinkwrap governs registry installs but not tarball installs (`build-tools/`)

npm decides whether to honor a dependency's bundled `npm-shrinkwrap.json` from the `_hasShrinkwrap`
flag in the **registry packument**, metadata the registry sets at publish time — not by looking
inside the tarball. So `npm install harper` from the registry installs exactly the tree the
shrinkwrap describes, including honoring _omissions_ (it will not re-resolve an optional dependency
that has been pruned out). But `npm install ./harper-*.tgz` has no packument, so npm never learns the
shrinkwrap exists and re-resolves the whole tree from `package.json`. Verified on one published
5.1.23 artifact: via the registry it honored the pin (fastify 5.8.5), from the tarball it resolved
fresh (fastify 5.10.0, then-latest).

Three consequences worth knowing before touching packaging:

- `overrides` in harper's `package.json` are **root-only** and do nothing for anyone installing
  harper. The shrinkwrap is the only lever that reaches consumers, which is why the react-native
  prune lives in `build-tools/prune-shrinkwrap-react-native.mjs` rather than in `overrides` (#1937).
- The published shrinkwrap is deliberately _not_ what `npm shrinkwrap` produced — `build.sh`
  post-processes it (dev prune #1783, optional subtree prune #1937 and the #3006 follow-up) to enforce that it describes only the
  production tree a consumer installs. Anything added there must keep it internally consistent; a
  pruned entry that something still requires would ship a broken tree to every consumer.
- The Dockerfile extracts the local tarball into a project directory and runs `npm install` there
  (rather than `npm install --global <tarball>`), so it reads `npm-shrinkwrap.json` off disk like any
  checked-out project and gets version pinning (#1960). It does **not** get the omission half: `npm
install` (unlike a registry install of harper as _someone else's_ dependency) reconciles the local
  project's own `package.json` against the lockfile, and the packed `package.json` prunes nothing —
  only the shrinkwrap does. `alasql`'s packed manifest still declares the react-native-fs optional
  edge, so plain `npm install` silently re-adds that whole pruned subtree to satisfy it. Closing that
  gap needs `npm ci` against a package.json where `alasql`'s own packed manifest has also had the edge
  removed — a bigger change to the published tarball than this dance, and not yet done. The Dockerfile
  does strip `devDependencies` from its _own extracted copy_ of `package.json` before installing (not
  the published tarball — registry consumers never see this) — not for `npm ci`'s sake, but because
  without it `npm install` still resolves dev edges to compute the ideal tree even under `--omit=dev`,
  which could silently lift a _production_ package that a devDependency also happens to want above its
  shrinkwrap pin. Confirmed empirically before landing: a hoisted production package's installed
  version tracked a devDependency's looser range instead of the shrinkwrap pin without this strip.
- Pinning inverts the old incident-remediation path, worth knowing before reaching for it: before
  #1960, rebuilding the image picked up any newer in-range dependency automatically, which is how a
  bad pin got fixed in production by "refresh/rebuild the image" alone. After #1960, the _pinned_ part
  of the tree is frozen to the shrinkwrap, so a remediation of that shape now needs a lock bump and a
  re-release — a rebuild alone reproduces the same tree, bug included. This does **not** apply to the
  react-native residual two bullets up: that subtree is still re-resolved fresh on every build, so a
  bug specific to it (not that anyone should want one there) actually would clear on a rebuild.

## Optional UTF-8 peers must not retain an unused native addon

Following [#3006](https://github.com/HarperFast/harper/pull/3006), after dev pruning, `prune-shrinkwrap-react-native.mjs` also severs `utf-8-validate` peers explicitly marked optional, unless the same consumer declares a dependency or optional dependency on it. Every supported Node version provides `buffer.isUtf8`, which `ws` uses before considering this addon. npm can hoist a copy produced by the dev framework's Harper peer into a production-reachable location: removing Harper's own declaration alone leaves it in the published shrinkwrap through `ws`'s optional peer. The existing reachability comparison removes only the addon and children exclusive to severed edges. Explicit dependencies, optional dependencies, required peers and shared children remain, including `bufferutil`'s `node-gyp-build`. Every non-severed edge of a surviving reachable package is traversed, so its target survives; severed edges are optional and may remain unresolved. The backstop checks required `dependencies` on leftover entries the root walk never visits. Real subprocess tests in `unitTests/buildTools/pruneShrinkwrapReactNative.test.js` enforce removal and preservation, including nested copies and the real production lock. Each rule reports its own removal count; retire the UTF-8 rule after updating the dev Harper peer to a release without the addon, once the full lock has neither an explicit producer nor an installed addon entry. A stale optional-peer-only entry still needs pruning even after its producer is gone. This guarantee applies to registry installs honoring the published shrinkwrap; tarball installs may re-resolve dependencies as described above.

## The image's shrinkwrap check must prove it could fail (`build-tools/check-shrinkwrap-pins.mjs`)

`docker-smoke.yml` runs this against the built image. Matching pins prove nothing where an unpinned
install would resolve the same versions, so the check also resolves the same `package.json` fresh
(lock-only, no shrinkwrap) and fails unless at least one checked edge differs there. That
requirement is why the check walks the whole packed tree, not a few named packages:

- **Direct dependencies cannot carry the proof.** Renovate's weekly non-major group moves every
  ranged direct dependency to its newest release that is at least 7 days old. The former
  hand-picked canaries went vacuous three times. On 2026-09-28, 27 of 28 ranged direct dependencies
  were at the newest version their range allowed. Transitive pins lag because renovate's
  `lockFileMaintenance` is off. If it is turned on, expect this check to fail right after each
  full refresh, until some pinned package publishes again.
- **Edges, not locations.** Each packed dependency edge is resolved node_modules-style in the packed
  map and in the installed tree. npm re-hoisting a pinned package to another path is not drift.
- **The exemption comes only from optional edges to `react-native-fs`**, the severed edge
  that the image re-adds (today only alasql declares one).
  The image re-adds that subtree (previous note), and it lifts shared pins such as the `@babel/*`
  packages `@endo/static-module-record` uses. Edges into that subtree, and the packed edges of a
  pinned package it lifted, are not pin-checked; a lifted shared pin prints a `::warning::`. A
  required edge the install resolved without a packed pin fails the check wherever it points:
  seeding the exemption from "anything unpinned" would exempt exactly the regression the check
  exists to catch. The exempt set becomes empty once alasql drops the optional edge.

## The published image runs `tini -g` as PID 1, not Harper (`Dockerfile`)

Harper used to be PID 1 in the published image. It is now started under `tini -g`, and that is
user-visible in four ways worth knowing before changing the entrypoint:

- **The restart watchdog depends on it.** `bin/restartExitWatchdog.ts` refuses to arm when
  `process.pid <= 1`, and the SIGKILL it delivers would be ignored by PID 1 anyway (the kernel
  drops unhandled signals to the init process). Harper being a _child_ is what makes a wedged
  restart teardown forcibly exit rather than hang until the orchestrator's own timeout.
- **`-g` forwards `docker stop`'s SIGTERM to Harper's process group**, not just Harper. This reaches
  descendants a component spawns in-group — they now receive SIGTERM directly instead of only seeing
  their parent go away — and is the boundary most likely to change behaviour for such a component. It
  does **not** reach Harper-managed subprocesses: `utility/processManagement/processManagement.js`
  forks them `detached: true`, which `setsid()`s them into their own group and session, so tini's
  group signal never arrives.
- **`docker exec … ps` and anything keying off PID 1** now sees `tini`, not `node`.
- **`docker run --init` nests a second init** above `tini`. Harmless, but redundant.

Volumes written by older PID-1 images stay compatible: `utility/processManagement` treats a pid
file naming PID 1 as stale when PID 1 is an init process, so a container restarted onto such a
volume does not refuse to start on a "still running" pid that is now `tini`.

## `build.sh` packages only a clean, error-free build (`build.sh`)

`build.sh` deletes `dist/` and stops when `npm run build` fails, so `npm run package` stops at a type error, and with it the release workflow, `npm-package-app-e2e` and the Docker image. It used to run `npm run build || true`. `tsc` emits even while reporting errors, so a failed build was still packaged, and a stale `dist/` could hide a declaration file the compiler had stopped emitting. TypeScript 6.0+ did exactly that for `dist/resources/Table.d.ts` until #2904 gave `makeTable()` an explicit public type. A local `npm run package` over a tree with type errors now fails instead of packaging; fix the error rather than restoring the tolerance.

## Emitted `dist/` JS is comment-free and Latin-1 (`build-tools/build-dist.mjs`)

V8 keeps the full source text of every loaded module on the heap of every thread (Node hands CJS
source to V8 as a heap string, and V8 needs it for lazy compilation and `Function.prototype.toString`),
and it stores the whole file as UTF-16 when a single char is above `0xFF`. Before this build, 224
loaded files held a `—` or `→` (almost always in a comment), which doubled their storage: module
source was 20.6 MB of a 58 MB idle worker heap, 14.3 MB of it in those files.

So `npm run build` emits JS with `removeComments` and a TypeScript `after` transformer that
re-creates any string or untagged template literal containing non-Latin-1 text as a synthesized
node, which the printer escapes (`—`) instead of copying the original text. Doing this in the
emitter rather than as a text rewrite keeps evaluated values exact (identity escapes, surrogate
pairs, interpolations) and lets source maps describe the final text. Declarations come from a
second, declaration-only pass so `.d.ts` keep their JSDoc. The build then fails if any non-Latin-1
char is left in `dist/**/*.js` — a tagged template is deliberately left untouched because its tag can
read `.raw`, so that is the case that would trip it.

`npm run build:watch` is plain `tsc --watch`: comments and non-Latin-1 text stay, which only costs
memory on a development box. harper-pro compiles core into its own `dist/core`, so it runs this
script with `--project tsconfig.json` rather than core's build.
