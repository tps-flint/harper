// Remove unused optional subtrees from the shrinkwrap that ships in the published package.
//
// alasql declares `optionalDependencies: { "react-native-fs": "^2.20.0" }`, and
// react-native-fs peer-depends on react-native *without* marking it optional. npm 7+
// auto-installs peer dependencies, so resolving alasql drags in react-native, react,
// hermes, metro and react-devtools-core — ~140MB and ~200 packages of code that cannot
// execute under Node: every `require('react-native-fs')` in alasql/dist/alasql.fs.js sits
// behind an `isReactNative` guard, and Harper only uses alasql.parse plus its function
// extensions. See #1937.
//
// This has to happen here rather than via an `overrides` entry in package.json, because
// npm honours `overrides` only for the root project — they have no effect on a consumer
// installing harper. The published shrinkwrap, by contrast, IS authoritative for registry
// installs: npm learns it exists from the `_hasShrinkwrap` flag in the packument and
// installs exactly the tree it describes. So pruning here is what actually reaches users.
//
// Same invariant as prune-shrinkwrap-dev.mjs — the published shrinkwrap should describe
// only the production tree a consumer needs — so this runs alongside it.
//
// ws also declares an optional utf-8-validate peer. All Node versions Harper supports
// provide buffer.isUtf8, which ws uses instead of that addon. A development dependency
// can install the addon into a shared location that ws keeps reachable after dev pruning.
// Sever only optional peer references: an explicit dependency or optionalDependency on
// the addon is preserved, since that consumer may actually use it.
//
// Deliberately surgical: it computes the set of packages reachable *with* the
// dispensable edges and the set reachable *without* them, and deletes only the
// difference, so the removed set is derived rather than a hardcoded list of directory
// names that would silently rot as alasql's tree shifts. A package left in the pruned
// shrinkwrap is therefore not proof that react-native never reached it: one a production
// dependency also needs stays.
//
// For react-native-fs, only edges declared as an `optionalDependency` are severed. A package
// that hard-depends on react-native-fs keeps it alive for the whole tree — otherwise
// severing every edge by name would delete a package another dependent still requires and
// leave that requirement dangling. Belt and braces, the result is checked for unresolved
// *required* edges before it is written, so a bad prune fails the build instead of
// shipping a broken shrinkwrap to every consumer.
//
// Retire the React Native rule when alasql no longer installs the unused subtree.
// Retire the UTF-8 rule after the dev framework's Harper peer updates to a release without
// the addon and the full lock has neither a producing declaration nor an addon copy.
// A stale copy reachable through optional peers still needs pruning even without a producer.
//
// Usage: node build-tools/prune-shrinkwrap-react-native.mjs [npm-shrinkwrap.json]
