# Dependencies

This page describes the dependencies of Harper, the reasons for their inclusion, and the steps and considerations for adding new third party package or dependency to Harper. This is intended to ensure that packages are added correctly with appropriate review and consideration.

A significant amount of work goes into minimizing the complexity and interdependencies of the Harper. Maintaining a minimum of dependencies requires discipline, and consequently a thorough review should be performed before considering the addition of any new packages or components of any substantial size. Addition of packages is similar to the economic concept of "negative externality", like carbon emissions, where a package may seem expedient for solving an immediate issue, but each package has a subtle negative impacts on the rest of the application, and the cumulative effect of numerous third-party packages gradually leads to increases in memory consumption, slowed performance, application complexity, dependency management, increased security vulnerabilities, and complex interactions that together slow down development, increase the difficulty of code maintenance, and reduce application usability.

Every addition of a dependency should be accompanied by a review of the performance, security, and complexity implications. Also, with every dependency, we should expect and plan for its eventual removal, whether that be due to issues that are found with package, need for improved performance, or neglect of the package maintenance. Every review should include a plan for how the dependency could eventually be removed with minimal impact.

Note that adding development dependencies (for testing, building, or other dev activities), should still involve some consideration, but does not require nearly the level of review, since it won't involve loading code in production.

In reviewing the third party package or dependency, the following questions should be addressed, and the proposed addition should be reviewed and vetted by the engineering team. The dependency and answers to questions can be appended to this document so all dependency justifications can be found here, as well as removal plans, and they can be reviewed together with code in pull requests.

- What is the size of the package, including all transitive dependencies (that aren't already included)?
- Can some or all be deferred?
- What is the security track record of this package?
- Does this have transitive dependencies that also add overhead, complexity, and security vulnerability?
- What is the memory cost? How much additional memory is required?
- What is the environment interaction? Does this alter any globals or constructs in the environment? Does this load any polyfills that alter existing objects?
- Is there any overlap in functionality with an existing packages? In what ways do existing packages fail to provide, or can't be extended to provide, the necessary functionality?
- Does this require binary compilation? (This has added some extra challenges)
- How would we eventually remove this package?

Generally, dependencies are added by simply adding them to the dependencies list in package.json. If the dependency is not necessary for the actual execution of the application (testing or building), it can be placed in devDependencies, or in optionalDependencies (we have done that with packages with binary compilations).

## react-native-fs (removed from the published tree, not a dependency)

This is the inverse of the entries below — a dependency we take deliberate steps to _not_ ship.

- Where it comes from: `alasql` declares `optionalDependencies: { "react-native-fs": "^2.20.0" }`, and `react-native-fs` peer-depends on `react-native` **without** marking it optional. npm 7+ auto-installs peer dependencies, so resolving alasql pulls in `react-native`, `react`, `hermes`, `metro` and `react-devtools-core` — ~140MB and ~200 packages (#1937).
- Why none of it is needed: every `require('react-native-fs')` in `alasql/dist/alasql.fs.js` sits behind a `utils.isReactNative` guard, so it is unreachable under Node. Harper only uses `alasql.parse` plus its function extensions.
- How it is removed: `build-tools/bundleDependencies.ts` omits unused optional `react-native-fs` declarations from copied package manifests before bundling the locked JavaScript closure. Its reachability walk preserves children shared with other production dependencies and never severs an explicit required producer. Development-installed manifests and the repository lock stay intact.
- Why bundling: root `overrides` do not constrain a consumer's install, and npm 12 [no longer honors shrinkwraps](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v12/using-npm/changelog/). The published `bundleDependencies` ships the tested JavaScript bytes for registry, tarball and global installs. Native-containing roots remain regular, exact-pinned dependencies so npm selects the consumer's platform; their ranged transitives and externally supplied optional peers are outside the bundle's reproducibility guarantee.
- Docker image: a standard global install uses the same portable bundle. The copied AlaSQL manifest no longer declares the unused optional edge, so the image no longer re-adds the React Native subtree. PR consumer tests run `npm ci` after installation, and archive/installed checks reject native binaries in the bundle and verify locked versions and shared storage-module resolution.
- Eventual removal: retire the React Native rule once AlaSQL stops declaring that optional dependency. The helper also cuts optional-peer-only `utf-8-validate` references when they appear in the bundled closure; explicit producers are preserved.

## graphql

- Need for usage: For supporting GraphQL schemas and queries.
- Size/memory cost: About 500KB
- Security: No reported vulnerabilities (impressive for a popular package) https://security.snyk.io/package/npm/graphql
- Overlap: None
- Can be deferred: Yes, this only loaded when a GraphQL schema is loaded.
- Binary compilation: No
- Eventual removal: It may be feasible to implement GraphQL parsing separately

## mqtt-packet

- Need for usage: We need to support MQTT
- Size/memory-cost: a couple hundred kilobytes with transitive dependencies
- Security: Had a vulnerability several major versions ago: https://security.snyk.io/package/npm/mqtt-packet
- Environment interaction: None
- Overlap: None
- Binary compilation: No
- Eventual removal: MQTT is a very well documented, and relatively simple specification, we can definitely implement this ourselves.

## ses

- Need for usage: Provides secure sand-boxing JavaScript environment
- Security: Developed by security experts with bounties for security issues
- Environment interaction: This creates a `lockdown` global function for deep freezing objects.
- Can be deferred: Yes, this only loaded when secure sand-boxing is enabled and modules are loaded.
- Eventual removal: Secure EcmaScript consists of a set of functionality that is all proposed as additions to EcmaScript itself, and the developers are probably the most influential people in TC-39.

## @endo/static-module-record

- Need for usage: Provides the safety verification of modules for loading into a secure JavaScript environment
  Environment interaction: None
- Can be deferred: Yes, this only loaded when secure sand-boxing is enabled and modules are loaded.
- Eventual removal: Same as above

## uWebSockets.js

- Need for usage: Optional high-performance HTTP/WebSocket backend (#914), gated default-off behind HARPER_UWS_UDS (plaintext UDS behind symphony) / HARPER_UWS_HTTP (direct plaintext TCP). Loaded lazily only when a flag is set.
- Size/memory cost: Prebuilt native V8 addon (~1MB per platform binary; the GitHub tarball contains all platform binaries).
- Security: Actively maintained C++ HTTP server; no npm advisory registry entry (installed from a pinned GitHub tarball, not from npm).
- Binary compilation: Yes — ABI-locked, platform-specific prebuilt `.node` binaries committed in the repo. No musl/Alpine (glibc only). Harper declares version 20.68.0 as an optional peer; operators enabling the backend must install the pinned GitHub tarball separately. It remains a devDependency so Harper's uWS test jobs install it without adding the GitHub tarball to consumers' production locks.
- Overlap: Overlaps `ws` (WebSockets) and the Node/Bun HTTP paths; this is an alternative transport, not an addition.
- Eventual removal: Kept as long as it demonstrates a meaningful throughput/latency win over the Node path; the flags let it be dropped without touching the default path.

## ws

- Need for usage: We need to support WebSockets
- Security: Had vulnerabilities, but quickly addressed: https://security.snyk.io/package/npm/ws
- Environment interaction: None
- Overlap: None
- Binary compilation: `bufferutil` is an optional native addon for masking acceleration. Harper does not declare `utf-8-validate`: `ws` uses Node's built-in [`buffer.isUtf8`](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#bufferisutf8input) (introduced in Node 18.14 and 19.4) on the Node versions declared in `package.json`'s `engines`. The development lock still includes an older addon produced by the integration test framework's Harper peer, also referenced by React Native's optional peers. Release bundling deliberately leaves `ws` and its optional native `bufferutil` accelerator as ordinary dependencies so consumers can override this transport independently. Optional-only peers are excluded from the bundle closure. Optional UTF-8 peer declarations are cut only when they occur inside copied bundled manifests; explicit producers and required peers are preserved. See `build-tools/DESIGN.md` for the bundle boundary.
- Eventual removal: Because this is a standard-based API, this will hopefully be rolled into a core JavaScript runtime feature at some point (and already is in Deno).

## json-bigint (forked as json-bigint-fixes)

- Need for usage: We need to support parsing and serializing ("stringify") JSON with big integers.
- Size/memory cost: About 30KB
- Security: Prototype pollution vulnerability was addressed: https://security.snyk.io/package/npm/json-bigint
  Unfortuneately this project has not been published for three years, although it does have commits in the last two years. Consequently, we have forked and published the latest, with the fixes it provides.
- Overlap: None
- Can be deferred: Too small to matter
- Binary compilation: No
- Eventual removal: This code could be maintained within our codebase, if necessary, as it is not very large.

## segfault-handler

- Need for usage: Provides a way to log segfaults in native code
- Size/memory cost: 10KB
- Security: No reported vulnerabilities
- Binary compilation: Yes (but included as an optional dependency)
- Eventual removal: This is a very small package, and it is not necessary, just adds debugging information

## tar-fs

- Need for usage: Used by package component to pack component project into tarball and by deploy component to extract tarball into component directory.
- Size/memory cost: Approximately 13KB
- Security: One medium level where an attacker can overwrite files on the system when extracting a tarball containing a hardlink to a file that already exists, this has since been fixed.
- Overlap: None
- Can be deferred: Potentially, we could load it on-demand
- Eventual removal: We could write our own code that read/writes multiple files from/to a tar file

## tar-stream

- Need for usage: The low-level USTAR pack/extract streams underneath `tar-fs`. Used directly by the RocksDB backup path (`dataLayer/rocksdbBackup.ts`) to append the database's file-backed blobs (and the generated READMEs) into the `get_backup` archive: the native engine backup emits a plain tar, and its entries are streamed on while blob/README entries are packed and appended before the single end-of-archive trailer. Declared as a direct dependency (rather than relied on transitively via `tar-fs`) so the import contract is stable across package-manager layouts.
- Size/memory cost: Approximately 30KB
- Security: None known
- Overlap: Pulled in transitively by `tar-fs` already; declaring it direct only pins the contract, no new tree.
- Can be deferred: Only loaded on the `get_backup` blob path
- Eventual removal: We could write our own minimal USTAR encoder (the engine binding already ships one)

## gunzip-maybe

- Need for usage: Used by deploy component
- Size/memory cost: Approximately 320B
- Security: None
- Overlap: None
- Can be deferred: Potentially, we could load it on-demand
- Eventual removal: We could write code to read the first bytes to determine what type of file it is and choose whether to gunzip it or not

## argon2id

- Need for usage: An optional extra secure password hashing algorithm used for hdb users
- Size/memory cost: 866KB
- Security: None
- Overlap: None
- Can be deferred: Potentially, we could load it on-demand
- Eventual removal: Yes, once node crypto adds native support for argon2

## chokidar

- Need for usage: Reliable file watching. This is the industry standard file watcher and deals with the many edge cases that node.js's watch (file replacement and changing inode for example) and watchFile (nothing but a terrible poller on a timer) don't handle well.
- 153KB
- Security: No known issues.
- Eventual removal: This is a very well maintained package and is the industry standard for file watching. We could remove with very careful usage of `watch`, but would probably require a lot of testing and edge case handling.

## send

- Need for usage: Used to serve static files and automatically handle range requests, headers, and other edge cases.
- Size: 49.6kB
- Security: No known issues.
- Eventual removal: This is a very well maintained package and is the industry standard for serving static files. We could remove with very careful usage of `fs` and `http`, but would probably require a lot of testing and edge case handling.

## compression, compression-1.7 (alias of compression@1.7.4), on-finished, on-headers (devDependencies)

- Need for usage: `unitTests/server/serverHelpers/nodeAdapterMiddleware.test.js` drives `Request.withNodeAdapter()` with the real Node middleware that first broke it (harper#2527): `compression` (1.8, and 1.7.4 under the `compression-1.7` alias because that is the version Next.js vendors and it gates on `_header`/`_implicitHeader()` rather than `headersSent`/`writeHead()`), `send` (already a dependency), and the `on-finished` / `on-headers` hooks they use. A synthetic handler cannot reproduce the ordering and backpressure contract these packages rely on.
- Size: about 170 kB installed including `compressible`, `negotiator`, `vary` and `bytes`; test-only, never loaded in production.
- Security: jshttp / expressjs maintained; no known issues.
- Eventual removal: drop when Harper ships its own Node-middleware conformance fixture, or when the `@harperfast/nextjs` integration suite covers the adapter end to end.

## easy-ocsp

- Need for usage: Provides OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) verification for TLS certificates to check if certificates have been revoked.
- Size/memory cost: Approximately 15KB
- Security: No reported vulnerabilities
- Environment interaction: None
- Overlap: Works alongside pkijs for certificate verification
- Can be deferred: Yes, only loaded when OCSP verification is enabled
- Binary compilation: No
- Eventual removal: Could be replaced when Node.js adds native OCSP support, or replaced by pkijs if it adds OCSP support

## pkijs

- Need for usage: Provides CRL (Certificate Revocation List) verification and advanced certificate parsing for TLS certificate validation. Used for parsing X.509 certificates, CRLs, and performing signature verification including Ed25519/Ed448 support (via patching).
- Size/memory cost: Approximately 350KB with asn1js dependency
- Security: No reported vulnerabilities. Well-maintained library by PeculiarVentures (security-focused company).
- Environment interaction: None
- Overlap: Complements easy-ocsp for certificate verification (CRL vs OCSP)
- Can be deferred: Yes, only loaded when certificate verification is enabled
- Binary compilation: No
- Transitive dependencies: Requires asn1js (also added as direct dependency for version control)
- Eventual removal: CRL functionality could potentially be implemented directly if needed, or replaced when Node.js adds native CRL support. However, pkijs is the industry standard for X.509 certificate operations in JavaScript.

## asn1js

- Need for usage: Required by pkijs for ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) parsing of certificates and CRLs. ASN.1 is the encoding standard for X.509 certificates.
- Size/memory cost: Approximately 100KB
- Security: No reported vulnerabilities. Maintained alongside pkijs by PeculiarVentures.
- Environment interaction: None
- Overlap: None (fundamental dependency for certificate parsing)
- Can be deferred: Yes, only loaded when certificate verification is enabled (loaded with pkijs)
- Binary compilation: No
- Eventual removal: Required as long as we use pkijs. Could be replaced if Node.js adds native ASN.1 parsing or if we implement our own X.509 parser.

## @aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime (optional peerDependency)

- Need for usage: AWS Bedrock backend for `scope.models` (#510 Phase 6 / #633). Bedrock requires SigV4-signed requests against region-specific endpoints; rolling SigV4 ourselves is non-trivial and the AWS SDK does it correctly. The SDK also handles the standard AWS credential chain (env vars, shared profile, IAM roles, IRSA) which is exactly what we want.
- Classification: **optional `peerDependency`**, not a direct dependency. Harper itself does not install the SDK — `package.json` declares it in `peerDependenciesMeta.@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime.optional: true`. Modern npm / pnpm / yarn skip the auto-install and do not warn. The backend dynamic-imports the SDK on first call and throws `BedrockBackendError('@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime is not installed. Add it to your project ...')` if it's missing. Customers that don't use the Bedrock backend pay zero install or runtime cost.
- Size/memory cost: ~5 MB unpacked including transitive `@smithy/*`, `@aws-sdk/*` packages. Only loaded for users who explicitly opt in by adding the SDK to their own project's `package.json`.
- Security: AWS-maintained, weekly-cadence releases. CVE history is in the standard AWS SDK channel; Harper does not freeze the patch range — operators install the version their project pins.
- Environment interaction: None at Harper load time (dynamic import only fires when a Bedrock backend is registered AND a `scope.models` call is made). At runtime, the SDK uses the standard AWS credential chain.
- Overlap: None. The other model backends (`ollama`, `openai`, `anthropic`) use native `fetch` directly; SigV4 is the genuine reason we use an SDK here and not on the other three.
- Transitive dependencies: Large `@smithy/*` set required by the SDK runtime. Acceptable because installation is opt-in via peerDep.
- Can be deferred: Yes, by design — dynamic-imported on first Bedrock call. Customers without Bedrock never load it.
- Binary compilation: No.
- Eventual removal: We could implement SigV4 ourselves (~300 lines) and call Bedrock's HTTP endpoint with native `fetch`, matching the pattern used by the other three backends. Worth revisiting if SDK version churn becomes a maintenance burden or if the optional-peerDep pattern proves operator-unfriendly. The dynamic-import boundary means the swap is contained to `components/bedrock/index.ts`.

## @aws-sdk/client-s3, @aws-sdk/lib-storage (optional peerDependencies)

- Need for usage: the `export_to_s3` operation (`dataLayer/export.ts`) and the `import_from_s3` operation (`dataLayer/bulkLoad.ts`, via `utility/AWS/AWSConnector.js`) — reading an S3 object to import, and multipart-uploading an export result to S3.
- Classification: **optional `peerDependency`**, not a direct dependency, mirroring `@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime` above. `package.json` declares both in `peerDependenciesMeta.<pkg>.optional: true`. `AWSConnector.js` and `dataLayer/export.ts` `require()` the SDKs lazily, through the shared `utility/AWS/awsSdkLoader.ts` helper, only when an S3 export/import actually runs. The helper first tries a normal `require()` (finds an SDK installed alongside Harper itself); if that's `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for one of these two packages, it retries with a `node:module` `createRequire` anchored at the configured Harper instance root (`rootPath`/`ROOTPATH`, e.g. `/home/harperdb/harper` in the official Docker image) — the volume an operator actually owns and where `npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3 @aws-sdk/lib-storage` naturally lands, since Harper's own code lives in a separate global `node_modules` tree the operator doesn't control (`$NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX/lib/node_modules/harper`) that a rootPath-local install would never reach via Node's normal `require` walk. If both attempts fail, `export_to_s3` and `import_from_s3` throw a 501 `MissingAwsSdkError` naming the rootPath: "S3 export/import requires the optional AWS SDK — npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3 @aws-sdk/lib-storage in the Harper instance root (<rootPath>), or alongside Harper globally". Every other operation is unaffected. The official Docker image (`Dockerfile`) preinstalls both packages globally alongside Harper, so S3 export/import works out of the box there — only npm/tarball consumers who never touch it get to skip the install.
- Size/memory cost: ~18 MB unpacked including transitive `@smithy/*` packages. Paid by the official Docker image (preinstalled) and by npm/tarball operators who explicitly add both SDKs to their own project's `package.json`; skipped by everyone else.
- Security: AWS-maintained, weekly-cadence releases. CVE history is in the standard AWS SDK channel; Harper does not freeze the patch range — operators install the version their project pins.
- Environment interaction: None at Harper load time (the `require()` only fires when `export_to_s3` or `import_from_s3` is invoked). At runtime, the SDK uses the credentials passed in the operation body (`aws_access_key_id`/`aws_secret_access_key`/`region`), not the ambient AWS credential chain.
- Overlap: None — no other Harper code path touches S3.
- Transitive dependencies: Large `@smithy/*` set shared with `@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime`'s tree. Acceptable because installation is opt-in via peerDep.
- Can be deferred: Yes, by design — lazily required on first S3 export/import call. Customers who never use these two operations never load it.
- Binary compilation: No.
- Eventual removal: Unlikely — S3's multipart upload and streamed-download semantics (`@aws-sdk/lib-storage`'s `Upload`, `GetObjectCommand`) are non-trivial to reimplement correctly. The lazy-load boundary means any future replacement is contained to `utility/AWS/awsSdkLoader.ts`, `utility/AWS/AWSConnector.js`, and `dataLayer/export.ts`.

## @harperfast/skills

- Need for usage: Ships the `harper-best-practices` skill content (rule index + per-rule guidance for schema design, relationships, auth, caching, vector indexing, TypeScript type-stripping, deployment, etc.) that the built-in agent uses to ground itself (#626). Sourcing it from the published package versions the guidance with the Harper release instead of drifting from a separately-updated copy.
- Size/memory cost: ~412KB on disk, no transitive dependencies. The package's single export (`.`) surfaces the skill content as JS — `skillSummary`, `ruleNames`, and a `rules` name→markdown map — so the rule bodies are resident in the worker's heap once imported (~400KB of markdown). Only the `SKILL.md` overview (~1.2K tokens) is fed into the agent's system prompt eagerly; individual rule bodies are handed to the model on demand via the `harper_best_practice` tool, so context spend still stays lazy.
- Security: No reported vulnerabilities; a first-party Harper package.
- Environment interaction: None. The skill content is consumed via the package's module exports — no filesystem access or dynamic resolution.
- Overlap: None.
- Can be deferred: No — it's a declared runtime dependency imported by the agent module. If the built-in agent is disabled the code path isn't exercised, but the module is still installed and imported like any other dependency.
- Binary compilation: No.
- Eventual removal: The best-practices content could be vendored directly into `harper` if the separate package ever became a maintenance burden, at the cost of losing independent versioning/updates.

## weak-lru-cache

- Need for usage: Powers the PrimaryRocksDatabase record cache. Stores record values under a WeakRef-based LRU so cached records are GC-reclaimable once they cycle out of the LRU stages — a strong-reference cache would be an unbounded leak, since every accessed record would be retained indefinitely. lmdb-js uses the same library for its CachingStore. Values are stored via `setValue`/`getValue` (WeakRef semantics) rather than `set`/`get` (strong semantics).
- Size/memory cost: ~6 KB. The cache itself is bounded by the LRU capacity; each slot holds only a WeakRef to the record, so GC can reclaim entries not recently accessed.
- Security: No reported vulnerabilities. Authored and maintained by David Beaumont / lmdb-js author (same authorship chain as lmdb-js, already a trusted dependency).
- Environment interaction: None.
- Overlap: lmdb-js already vendors this for its CachingStore; adding it as a direct dep aligns with the existing usage pattern and avoids importing a private lmdb-js internal.
- Can be deferred: No — the WeakLRUCache is constructed at store-open time for tables with caching enabled.
- Binary compilation: No.
- Eventual removal: Could be replaced by a custom WeakRef-based LRU if the dependency ever lapses, or removed if a native VT-only freshness check (without a JS-side record cache) proves sufficient.

## busboy

- Need for usage: Streaming multipart/form-data parser for the operations API. Required so `deploy_component` payloads can exceed the Node.js 2 GB Buffer cap by being piped straight into extraction (gunzip + tar-fs) instead of buffered. Used only on the operations API ingest path; outbound multipart bodies on the CLI are formatted inline in `bin/multipartBuilder.ts` and do not depend on busboy.
- Size/memory cost: ~50 KB on disk including its sole transitive dep `streamsearch` (~7 KB). Memory overhead is per-request and bounded by busboy's configured `fieldSize`/`fields` limits plus the natural backpressure of the file Readable it emits.
- Security: No CVEs against busboy ≥ 1.0. Pre-1.0 had a couple of low-severity DoS reports against the field/parts limits, all fixed by the configurable limits we now use (`fieldSize`, `fields`, `files`). Active maintenance by the Fastify org (busboy is the underpinning of @fastify/multipart and most Node multipart implementations).
- Environment interaction: None. Pure Node streams, no global mutation, no polyfills.
- Overlap: None. Node's built-in HTTP/streams don't parse multipart. Alternatives considered: `@fastify/multipart` (adds Fastify-specific decorators we don't need and steers towards the buffered-file model we're trying to avoid), `formidable` (heavier, file-to-disk by default), and writing our own parser (multipart edge cases like nested boundaries, quoted parameters, and CRLF/LF tolerance are not worth re-implementing). busboy gives us the precise low-level event model — field/file with Readable — that the operations API needs.
- Transitive dependencies: `streamsearch` only (also Fastify-maintained).
- Binary compilation: No.
- Can be deferred: The require happens only when `server/serverHelpers/multipartParser.ts` is imported, which is loaded by `registerContentHandlers` at operations-server boot. Realistically always loaded.
- Eventual removal: Could be replaced by writing our own streaming multipart parser (a few hundred lines plus tests for edge cases) if maintenance ever lapses, or by Node.js's `request.formData()` once that API supports streaming file parts without buffering (currently it doesn't on the standard Node http server interface used by Fastify).

## typescript@7 (not a dependency — invoked via npx, pinned separately from the `typescript` devDependency)

- Need for usage: TypeScript 7 merges the native (Go-ported) compiler preview directly into the `typescript` package's `tsc` binary — there is no separate `tsgo` binary or `@typescript/native-preview` package at 7.0.2+. Wired as an opt-in `npm run typecheck:fast` script — a faster local/CI type-check loop alongside the existing `tsc`-based `build`, not a replacement for either.
- Not a `package.json` dependency: `typecheck:fast` runs `npx -y -p typescript@<pinned-version> tsc ...` rather than adding this as a `devDependency`. This is deliberate, and for the same reason as before: an earlier version of this change had the equivalent tool (`@typescript/native-preview`) as a plain `devDependency`, which meant `npm ci` fetched it for every CI job (unit, integration, smoke, stress), not just the opt-in checker. Since the package name here is `typescript` — the same name as our existing 5.x devDependency — it also could not be added as a second `package.json` entry at a different version without colliding; `npx -p typescript@7.0.2` sidesteps this too, resolving and running the pinned 7.x tarball from npm's npx cache without touching the project's installed 5.x `typescript`. Running it via `npx` on-demand confines a pruned-tarball failure to `typecheck:fast` alone, matching its actually-opt-in nature. Trade-off: no `package-lock.json` integrity-hash pinning for this tool (the exact version is still pinned in the npx invocation itself, just not hash-verified against a lockfile entry).
- Security: Microsoft-maintained TypeScript compiler, same publisher/package as the 5.x devDependency.
- Overlap: Complements, does not replace, the `typescript` devDependency, which stays on 5.x because it emits the published `dist/`. 7.0.x miscompiles a computed `import()` in CommonJS output under `rewriteRelativeImportExtensions` (microsoft/typescript-go#4771, fixed for 7.1), and 6.0+ stops emitting `dist/resources/Table.d.ts` until `makeTable()` has an explicit public type. `renovate.json` holds the devDependency off 6.0.x–7.0.x and gates majors on the Dependency Dashboard. The 5.x and 7.x versions never coexist in `node_modules` at once: 5.x is the installed devDependency, 7.x is fetched on-demand by `npx` purely for `typecheck:fast`.
- Eventual removal: Once the `typescript` devDependency moves to a 7.x release whose emitted `dist/` matches 5.x apart from formatting, this becomes redundant and `typecheck:fast` can be dropped.

## @inquirer/input, @inquirer/password, @inquirer/select, @inquirer/confirm

- Need for usage: Interactive CLI prompting (`bin/login.ts`, `bin/deploySetup.ts`, `utility/install/installer.ts`, `upgrade/upgradePrompt.ts`). Replaces `inquirer@8.2.7` and `prompt@1.3.0`, both removed in the same change (HarperFast/harper#1038). Declared as the four individual subpath packages Harper actually calls (`input`, `password`, `select`, `confirm`) rather than the `@inquirer/prompts` umbrella, which bundles all ten prompt implementations — including `editor`, which pulls in `@inquirer/external-editor` and its `chardet`/`iconv-lite` — behind one import. That matters here specifically because `utility/interactivePrompts.ts` loads on the server **boot** path (`bin/run.ts` → `hdbInfoController` → `upgradePrompt` → this module, for the downgrade-confirmation gate), not just from interactive CLI entry points, so the umbrella's unused prompt types were dead weight paid on every server start. Within that module, each of the four is further loaded via a lazy `import()` on first actual prompt call rather than at module evaluation, so a boot path that reaches `upgradePrompt` without ever needing a prompt (the common case) pays nothing at all. `@inquirer/core` (the package all four depend on, and the one that raises `ExitPromptError` on Ctrl-C) is **not** a direct dependency here — it's resolved transitively through them. Cancel detection in `utility/interactivePrompts.ts` matches `error.name === 'ExitPromptError'` rather than an `instanceof` check against `@inquirer/core`'s class, specifically so detecting a cancel never needs its own import: by the time a real cancel can happen, whichever prompt package was actually invoked has already pulled `@inquirer/core` in as its own dependency.
- Size/memory cost: 648KB unpacked, 14 packages total (measured via a clean, isolated `npm install --omit=dev` of exactly these four package names — no umbrella, no direct `@inquirer/core`): `@inquirer/ansi`, `@inquirer/confirm`, `@inquirer/core`, `@inquirer/figures`, `@inquirer/input`, `@inquirer/password`, `@inquirer/select`, `@inquirer/type`, `cli-width`, `fast-string-truncated-width`, `fast-string-width`, `fast-wrap-ansi`, `mute-stream`, `signal-exit` — identical tree either way, since `@inquirer/core` is installed regardless of whether it's a direct or transitive edge; only `package.json`'s own dependency list changes. This replaces `inquirer@8.2.7` (pulled in `rxjs`, ~12MB) and `prompt@1.3.0` (pulled in `winston` + `async`, ~5MB) — combined ~18MB removed for a 648KB addition, roughly a third the size of the `@inquirer/prompts` umbrella (~1.6MB for the same clean-install method, once the six unused prompt types and `external-editor`'s tree are included). `@inquirer/type` declares `@types/node` as an _optional_ peerDependency (unlike `inquirer@8`'s chain, which pulled it in as a real production dependency via `@inquirer/external-editor`); the isolated install confirms it is not installed. (`npm ls @types/node` inside this repo's own checkout will still show it — that's dedup against the `@types/node` this repo's own devDependencies already hoist to the top level, not evidence of a production install. `npm ls @types/node --omit=dev` is the check that matters, and it's empty.)
- Security: No reported vulnerabilities. Actively maintained by the same author (SBoudrias) as the `inquirer` package it replaces; no `rxjs` in the dependency graph (the entire class of issue that made `inquirer@8` heavy).
- Environment interaction: None beyond normal stdin/stdout TTY interaction for the prompt it's running.
- Overlap: None — this is the sole prompting library now; `inquirer` and `prompt` are both removed.
- Can be deferred: Yes, at the package level — each prompt's dynamic `import()` only fires on first real call. The call sites themselves (login, install, deploy setup, upgrade downgrade-confirmation) are synchronous CLI flows that block on the answer once a prompt is actually shown.
- Binary compilation: No.
- Eventual removal: Low-priority to remove given the size is already minimal; a future removal would mean hand-rolling readline-based prompting for the same four call sites.

## @harperfast/hnsw (optional dependency)

- Need for usage: Supplies the file-primary memory-mapped HNSW index used by new eligible audited HNSW indexes by default and by indexes that explicitly set `nativePlane: true`. Harper keeps primary-key mappings and the replay cursor vector in RocksDB; graph nodes and adjacency exist only in the native file.
- Size/memory cost: The JS/package metadata is about 250 KB unpacked plus one platform-specific native binary. Runtime mapped-file size is approximately 1,088 bytes per 768-dimensional int8 node at the default layer-0 cap of 64 (`nativePlaneLayer0Cap`); mappings are shared by the OS page cache across workers.
- Security: First-party Apache-2.0 Harper package. It runs native code in-process, so Harper exact-pins the package and its own manifest exact-pins every platform prebuild to the same version. The dedicated CI job loads the registry prebuild and tests Harper against it.
- Environment interaction: Lazily loaded while deciding whether a new audited index can use the default, or when native mode is explicit/persisted; it creates a memory-mapped `.hnsw` derived-index file next to the index store and may create a `.stale` invalidation sidecar. `HNSW_NO_NATIVE_DEFAULT=1` prevents automatic selection for new indexes without changing persisted modes. It does not modify globals or install polyfills.
- Overlap: None for a native index. Existing HNSW descriptors without `nativePlane`, incompatible indexes, and declarations with `nativePlane: false` continue to use the JS/RocksDB graph; native indexes use insert, mutation, and search through the shared post-commit derived-index runtime.
- Transitive dependencies: Only exact-version, platform-specific optional prebuild packages; no JS runtime dependency tree.
- Binary compilation: Supported Linux glibc x64/arm64, macOS arm64, and Windows x64 targets use prebuilds. Other targets attempt a Rust source build. Because the root package is optional Harper still installs if that build fails, but opted-in indexes remain unavailable until the module is present.
- Can be deferred: Yes by setting `nativePlane: false` per index or `HNSW_NO_NATIVE_DEFAULT=1` before declaring new indexes. During a rolling cluster upgrade, keep the switch enabled everywhere until every node supports replicated-attribute fallback. An explicitly enabled or persisted native index returns 503 and retries rebuild when the module is unavailable.
- Eventual removal: Set `nativePlane: false` on native indexes, allow each schema reindex to rebuild the ordinary JS/CF graph, disable the automatic default, then remove the optional dependency and adapter integration.

## @harperfast/fulltext (optional dependency)

- Need for usage: Supplies the Tantivy-backed native index used by Harper full-text derived indexes. Harper remains the source of truth; each node builds and advances its local index from committed records through the shared derived-index runtime.
- Size/memory cost: The root package is about 260 KB installed, plus one platform-specific native package (about 6.1 MB on macOS arm64). Runtime memory and native index size depend on the indexed text, analyzer, and stored-field options.
- Security: First-party Apache-2.0 Harper package wrapping Tantivy. It runs native code in-process, so Harper exact-pins the root package and the package exact-pins every platform prebuild to the same version.
- Environment interaction: Lazily loaded only when a full-text index is activated. It creates Tantivy index files in Harper's derived-index directory; those files are disposable local state and are rebuilt or replayed from Harper records after loss or incompatibility. A format-incompatible package upgrade rebuilds each node's local indexes and returns 503 for full-text queries on that node until they are ready; use a rolling upgrade to keep other nodes available.
- Overlap: None. Harper owns schema, transactions, replication, source-record reads, and derived-index coordination; the package owns native indexing, persistence, and search execution.
- Transitive dependencies: Only exact-version, platform-specific optional prebuild packages; no JavaScript runtime dependency tree.
- Binary compilation: Supported Linux glibc x64/arm64, macOS arm64, and Windows x64 targets use prebuilds. Because the root package is optional, Harper still installs if a native package is unavailable, but a declared full-text index cannot activate until the module is installed.
- Can be deferred: Yes. The module is not loaded for tables without full-text indexes.
- Eventual removal: Remove full-text declarations and their local derived-index files, then remove the optional dependency and Harper adapter. Source records remain authoritative and unaffected.
