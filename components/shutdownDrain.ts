/**
 * Per-worker registry of graceful "drain before shutdown" hooks.
 *
 * On a worker restart (deploy reload, `harper dev` reload, rolling restart) the worker is told to shut
 * down while it may still be doing work that is cheaper to finish than to interrupt — notably a
 * replication blob *send* streaming to a peer. Tearing that down mid-stream makes the peer receiver
 * treat the blob as diverged until it is re-requested. A registered drain lets that work reach a safe
 * point (finish, or stall) before the worker stops accepting connections and exits.
 *
 * Core stays deliberately generic here — it knows nothing about blobs or replication. A component
 * (harper-pro replication) registers a {@link ShutdownDrain}; the worker shutdown path
 * ({@link server/threads/threadServer}) awaits {@link runShutdownDrains} before `closeServers`, and
 * extends its termination backstops (see manageThreads `extendShutdownDeadline`) only while
 * {@link shutdownDrainsHaveWork} reports real in-flight work — so a worker that hangs for an unrelated
 * reason is still force-killed on the normal short timeout.
 *
 * State is module-local, so it is naturally per-worker (each worker is a fresh module realm).

 * itself capped at `MAX_TIMER_MS` (see `getShutdownDrainCeilingMs`), but adding `baseMs` headroom on
 * top can push the sum back over the limit at the extreme end of the configured ceiling, silently
 * defeating the overflow guard the ceiling clamp was meant to provide.

 * Call it from `handleApplication`: the registry is per worker and is snapshotted the moment the

 * `scope.once('close', …)`: a restart-free reload closes the old scope in this same worker and would
 * otherwise leave the stale hook registered, while at a real shutdown the snapshot is already taken
 * when `'close'` listeners run, so the hook still drains. `hasWork()` returning `true` holds the worker
 * open up to `replication.blobSendDrainTimeout` (default 10 minutes; `0` disables draining).
 * `drain(deadlineMs)` must settle by that absolute time; a hook that ignores it is abandoned, and a
 * throw or rejection is logged and treated as settled. On Windows, macOS and Bun the replacement
 * worker starts only after this one is told to stop, so a hook that keeps an exclusive listener open
