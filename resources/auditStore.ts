/**
 * This module is responsible for the binary representation of audit records in an efficient form.
 * This includes a custom key encoder that specifically encodes arrays with the first element (timestamp) as a
 * 64-bit float, second (table id) as a 32-unsigned int, and third using standard ordered-binary encoding
 *
 * This also defines a binary representation for the audit records themselves which is:
 * 1 or 2 bytes: action, describes the action of this record and any flags for which other parts are included
 * tableId
 * recordId
 * origin version
 * previous local version
 * 1 or 2 bytes: position of end of the username section. 0 if there is no username
 * 2 or 4 bytes: node-id
 * 8 bytes (optional): last version timestamp (allows for backwards traversal through history of a record)
 * username
 * remaining bytes (optional, not included for deletes/invalidation): the record itself, using the same encoding as its primary store

/**
 * The bound a prune should use — and record — in place of an unbounded cutoff.
 *
 * `Infinity` is a legitimate thing for a caller to *mean* ("remove all of it") and a ruinous thing to
 * store: it is the unknown sentinel, and the sentinel is absorbing. `raiseAuditFloor`'s lock-free
 * pre-check skips any present record no cutoff exceeds, and `establishAuditFloor` skips any store that
 * has one, so a floor at `Infinity` never comes back down — for the whole database, including sibling
 * tables whose own history was never touched. One `deleteHistory(Infinity)` would otherwise retire the
 * accessor for that database permanently (#2458).
 *
 * So bound it by what exists: strictly above the newest key currently in the log, and never below the
 * clock. Nothing already written can escape that bound, and a caller that passes it as the prune's
 * range end as well as its floor cannot remove anything the floor does not cover — which is what makes
 * the write-ahead ordering hold without an infinite bound. An entry written *after* this returns is
 * simply not history the call asked to remove.
 *
 * `Infinity` is only the extreme case. Any cutoff above this bound is the same defect by degree: a
 * finite year-2286 bound (`Date.now() * 1000`, or a bare `'9999999999999'`) is equally unreachable
 * and equally permanent, and entries written after the prune then land *below* the recorded floor,
 * so the floor's promise — nothing after it was pruned — is false about history that is still there.
 * Every cutoff is therefore clamped, not just the unbounded one.
 *
 * Non-numbers, NaN, negatives and `-0` fall through unchanged to `raiseAuditFloor`, which rejects
 * them: the numeric ones are ordered keys the prune range would honor, not bounds anyone meant, and a
 * non-number is guarded explicitly because `>` would otherwise coerce it into a bound the floor
 * accepts. `cutoff > bound` rather than `Math.min` keeps NaN falling through too.
 *
 * On RocksDB `getKeys` is unimplemented and returns `[]`, so the bound reduces to `Date.now()`. A
 * key above the clock therefore survives a purge that asked for it on that engine. That is the safe
 * direction: the entry is kept and the floor stays honest, where the alternative removes history the
 * floor does not cover.

 * Give a database a trustworthy floor if it has none: the current time, as a one-time resync epoch.
 *
 * The floor record's *presence* is the trust marker, so a store without one is a store whose
 * retention history we cannot account for. It may have been pruned by a version that recorded no
 * floor; it may be the empty audit store an LMDB→RocksDB migration deliberately leaves behind
 * (`bin/copyDb.ts` does not migrate it, so the records and their resumable cursors outlive their
 * history); or it may be a database restored from a table-scoped backup taken without
 * `include_audit`, which carries records but no audit DBI. Cursors from before this moment are
 * therefore reported stale — not because we know they are, but because we do not know they are not.
 *
 * There is no "brand new store, use a permissive baseline" case: creating the audit DBI proves only
 * that the DBI was absent, which the audit-less backup above also produces. Being conservative on a
 * genuinely new database costs nothing, since its entries are all written after this instant.
 *
 * In read-only mode nothing is written and the floor stays unknown — the fail-closed answer for a
 * process that cannot record what it does not know.
 *
 * **The epoch is also recorded under its own key, so this bootstrap is repairable.** The epoch is a
 * guess bounded by surviving state, and surviving state cannot see history a selective prune already
 * removed (see the clock note below). The record marks the store as one that carried a guess, and
 * preserves the value guessed — the two facts a later release needs to raise such a floor to
 * something it can stand behind. See "Audit retention floor" in DESIGN.md for the full reading.
 *
 * **The mark is the signal, not a comparison against the floor.** A store carrying this record has an
 * unverified pre-tracking window for as long as it exists, however far the floor has since moved: a
 * prune raising the floor above the epoch certifies only what that prune removed, and says nothing
 * about history removed before tracking began — which may sit above the epoch, since that is exactly
 * the case the guess cannot see. A floor that has climbed past it does not retire it. Resumable
 * positions never depend on it: each is bound to a database generation minted after tracking began,
 * so the pre-tracking window lies below every one of them (`getDatabaseGeneration`).
 *
 * Ordering. The provenance record is written **first**, so a crash between the two writes leaves a
 * record with no floor — which the next open retries, since the early return above tests the floor.
 * The epoch actually stamped is always read back from the record rather than taken from this call's
 * own `Date.now()`, so a worker whose record lost the race adopts the winner's value and the two
 * always agree. Re-adopting an older record is sound: nothing was pruned in the meantime, or a prune
 * would have written the floor this function returns early on.

/**
 * The floor of this database's retained audit history: every audit entry at or after the returned
 * time is still retained, and below it the log may have lost anything. Returns `Infinity` when the
 * floor is unknown, which fails closed — no cursor compares as safe. A resume is decided by the
 * database generation and its resume floor (`getDatabaseGeneration`) instead: this floor survives a
 * restore, and an unknown one is absorbing.
 *
 * **One exception, and it is the only one: history removed before the floor existed.** Every prune
 * that runs with a floor recorded is covered — it raises the floor first, so it cannot remove an entry
 * the floor does not cover. But the first open stamps a floor from what *survives*
 * (`establishAuditFloor`), and a legacy `Table.deleteHistory` that removed a table's newest entries,
 * followed by a clock rollback, leaves that stamp below history that is gone; a cursor in the window
 * is then certified over the gap. So the guarantee is one-directional for tracked prunes and silent
 * about untracked ones. Resumable positions do not face it: they are checked against the database
 * generation and its resume floor (`getDatabaseGeneration`), not against this floor, which also steers
 * `Table.commit`'s reconciliation and so cannot move in the direction a cursor check would want.
 *
 * The time domain is the audit-log key: what `subscribe`'s events carry as `localTime` and what MQTT
 * durable sessions persist as `startTime`, so those compare against the floor directly.
 * **`getHistory` is not in that domain** — it reports each entry's origin `version` under the name
 * `localTime`, which a backdated or replicated write makes differ from the audit-log key. A cursor
 * saved from `getHistory` is not comparable to this floor.
 *
 * **Database-scoped**, and deliberately conservative: the audit store is per-database and its
 * entries carry a `tableId`, so a per-table floor would need a scan for the first entry matching
 * that table. For a valid cursor, `cursor >= floor` therefore means no entry of *any* table in the
 * database was removed *after* the cursor. What it never promises is anything below the FLOOR — that
 * history is exactly what a prune takes. Below the *cursor* is not the same set: for a cursor strictly
 * above the floor, `[floor, cursor)` sits below the cursor and is still covered by the guarantee. `Table.deleteHistory`
 * prunes one table out of that shared log and raises the whole database's floor, which can overstate
 * the floor for its siblings.
 *
 * **A moment-in-time observation.** Retention can advance between this call and whatever the caller
 * does with the answer, so a check-then-resume sequence has a window where the floor moves under it.
 * Closing that requires validating the position inside the resume itself (harper#2448), against the
 * generation and the resume floor; until then a lost race degrades to the truncation that happens
 * today, never to anything worse.
 *
 * **On RocksDB the floor tracks the configured horizon, not retained reality.** That branch purges at
 * whole-log-file granularity, so it cannot know before the fact which entries a purge will drop, and
 * the floor has to be written first — so every retention pass advances it to
 * `Date.now() - auditRetention / (1 + priority²)` whether or not a file was dropped. Entries below
 * that horizon are routinely still on disk, and a consumer holding a cursor among them is told to
 * resync. Conservative in the one safe direction, and the reason the LMDB branch (which can see a
 * single eligible entry) instead raises off the first one it finds.
 *
 * **Copies of a database's state.** `restore_backup` copies this record with everything else, and it
 * stays accurate for the log the restore carried; a branch checkpoint copies it with no log at all.
 * What a copy changes is which history the database is, and that is the database generation's to
 * answer: every copy path stamps a new one (`stampDatabaseGeneration`), and a copy that carried no log
 * raises this floor to the generation's epoch.
