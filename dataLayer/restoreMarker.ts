/**
 * Restore lock + marker protocol for RocksDB database restores (online operation and offline CLI),
 * and the shared per-database exclusion used by `dropDatabase` so a drop and a restore can never
 * mutate the same directory concurrently.
 *
 * Restore metadata lives in an isolated `` `restore` `` directory *beside* the database directory
 * (never inside it, since a restore purges the destination). Each database's two files are keyed by
 * a hash of the database directory name rather than being suffixed onto the name itself. That keeps
 * them out of the database-name namespace — a legal database literally named `orders.restoring`
 * would otherwise be mistaken for the restore marker of `orders`, and a 250-character name plus a
 * `.restore.lock` suffix would exceed the 255-byte `NAME_MAX` on most filesystems. The directory
 * name deliberately contains a backtick: `schemaRegex` (the database-name validator) forbids only
 * `/` and `` ` `` among filesystem-legal characters, so no legal database can ever occupy this path
 * — including a database literally named `.restore` (which *is* a legal name, so a plain `.restore`
 * directory would collide with it and land the markers inside the live database). The directory is
 * not itself a RocksDB/LMDB database (no `CURRENT`/`MANIFEST-`/`.mdb`), so the startup scan ignores
 * it, and no user can create a database that resolves to it.
 *
 * - `<meta-dir>/<key>.lock` — an OS-level exclusive file lock (via rocksdb-js `tryFileLock`),
 *   effective across processes, containers, and worker threads, auto-released on process exit.
 *   Only *held-ness* is meaningful; the file itself persists after release (harmless). Held for the
 *   duration of a restore, and briefly by `dropDatabase` so the two serialize on the same primitive.
 *   Known limitation: the lock is owned by the process, so if the restore job's worker *thread*
 *   dies without the process exiting, the lock stays held (restores 409) until Harper restarts.
 * - `<meta-dir>/<key>.restoring` — the completion marker. Published (temp → fsync → rename → parent
 *   fsync) after the lock is acquired and before the destructive restore begins; deleted only after
 *   the restore completes successfully, while still holding the lock. Its *existence* means "a
 *   restore started and has not finished successfully". Its first line records the database
 *   directory name as a fallback so the startup scan can map a marker whose database directory is
 *   missing without decoding the hashed key.
 *
 *   The rename is what makes the marker trustworthy: the marker path only ever holds the previous
 *   content or the complete new content, so a torn write can never replace a valid marker with one
 *   the scan reads as empty (and therefore honors as no block). An intact marker is also never
 *   rewritten at all — see `beginRestore`.
 * - `<meta-dir>/<key>.dropping` — durable database-drop intent for one physical root. Every root in
 *   a logical database receives its marker before any root is destroyed. Startup scans block marked
 *   roots, and retrying the same drop removes remaining roots and the blob directories recorded for
 *   their physical store identities before clearing the markers. The recorded identity is covered by
 *   a digest, so damaged marker content fails closed instead of redirecting blob deletion.
