/**
 * The machine-readable identification carried by a `get_backup` archive.
 *
 * The manifest is the first entry in the tar because a `.tar.gz` must be inflated from the start to
 * reach a later entry: a trailing manifest would cost a full pass over a multi-gigabyte archive just
 * to decide whether to reject it.
 *
 * Compatibility is a capability list rather than a version comparison. What makes an archive
 * unreadable is a format the target cannot decode, and the engine-level ones already fail closed on
 * their own (RocksDB refuses a `format_version` it does not understand). The ones that do not are
 * record struct mode (DESIGN.md "Struct mode is gated to primary DBIs"), transaction-log framing,
 * and deflate-compressed blob bodies (harper#2443). So the producer declares what a reader needs and
 * the reader refuses any token it does not have; new tokens are additive, and an older reader
 * refusing an unknown one is the intended answer.
