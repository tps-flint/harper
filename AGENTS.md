## What This Is

Harper is a Node.js unified development platform that fuses a document database (RocksDB-backed), in-memory cache, application runtime, and messaging broker (WebSockets, MQTT, NATS) into a single in-process runtime. This directory is the open-source core (`harper` npm package, Apache-2.0), which is the base for the enterprise `harper-pro` wrapper above it.

## Commands

```bash
# Build
npm run build              # TypeScript → dist/ via build-tools/build-dist.mjs (comment-free, Latin-1 JS; .d.ts keep JSDoc)
npm run build:watch        # Incremental watch build (plain tsc: keeps comments and non-Latin-1 text)

# Lint / Format
npm run lint               # oxlint (warnings = errors)
npm run lint:fix           # Auto-fix
npm run format:write       # Prettier

# Test — run specific suites
npm run test:unit                  # All unit tests (mocha)
npm run test:unit:main             # Core unit tests (excludes apiTests, lmdb, resources)
npm run test:unit:resources        # Resource layer tests
npm run test:unit:server           # Server layer tests
npm run test:unit:dataLayer        # Data layer tests
npm run test:unit:components       # Component/plugin system tests
npm run test:unit:security         # Security tests
npm run test:unit:apitests         # API tests (stops running server first)
npm run test:unit:lmdb             # LMDB storage engine tests
npm run test:unit:windows          # The Windows CI gate — a scoped slice, see below
npm run test:integration           # Full integration test suite
```

**Resources:** CI runs this suite as two steps — `test:unit:resources:core` and `test:unit:resources:indexes` — so the step budget stays spendable as the suite grows, and so a wedged run is reported in 8 minutes rather than 12 (harper#2660). `:indexes` is the `*{[Ii]ndex,[Hh]nsw,[Vv]ector}*.js` files and `:core` is the same glob with that pattern excluded, so the two are an exact partition and a newly added file lands in `:core` rather than in neither. `test:unit:resources` is untouched — still one mocha process over the whole suite — so `test:unit:all`, `test:unit:lmdb` and a local full run behave exactly as before, and it is what to run locally to check that the two shards still add up. It is only a partial backstop in CI: the sole workflow path that reaches it is `test:unit:lmdb`, so a file the two globs stopped covering would still get LMDB execution but, `vectorIndexPlane.test.js` and `blob.test.js` aside, no default-engine (RocksDB) execution. To reproduce a red CI step locally, run that step's script.

**Windows:** `test:unit:windows` is what the `unit-test-windows` CI job runs, and it covers only the part of the unit tree verified green on Windows. If you touch platform-specific code, run it — the Ubuntu jobs will not catch a Windows-only break. `unitTests/windowsGate.mjs` holds the scope and the list of suites still excluded, each with the reason; shrinking that list is welcome work. The gate runs one mocha process per directory and fails any group that exits without printing a summary line — keep both. A mocha run can stop advancing with nothing failed (`timeout: 0` in `.mocharc.json` means no test ever times out), in which case the event loop drains and the process exits 0 having printed no epilogue; that reads as a pass to every runner. `unitTests/mocha.init.js` fails such a run from the inside, and the gate's summary check backstops a process that never gets that far.

Run a single test file directly:

```bash
npx mocha unitTests/resources/mytest.js
```

TypeScript is stripped at runtime via `--conditions=typestrip` (Node.js native type stripping) — no compilation required for development. Use `npm run test:unit:typestrip` to run tests with this mode.

**Unit-test isolation:** every mocha run gets its own per-PID root under `unitTests/envDir/<pid>` — config file, log, keys, and every database including `system` (`unitTests/mocha.init.js` builds it before any test loads; `setupTestDBPath()` re-asserts the paths). A suite that needs the system tables to exist seeds them with `ensureSystemTables()` from `unitTests/testUtils.js` (system tables, a super_user role with an `admin` user, self-signed certs — what an install would create). After each test file, `unitTests/perFileDatabaseTeardown.js` drops every database that file created, and on RocksDB also removes one it closed but left on disk (the module header says why). So a test file must not depend on a database another file created, and must not create one in a root-level hook or test (outside any `describe`); `system`, configured databases and databases that existed before the file started are kept. Unit runs therefore stay out of an installed Harper root, can run while a local Harper is running, and work on a machine with no Harper install at all. Known carve-outs: `test:unit:apitests` still stops a running Harper first, for port reasons only (a wildcard-bound instance holds `*:9925/9926/1883`, starving the loopback-address pool); and the few test files that clear mocha.init.js's `ROOTPATH` export to exercise boot-props resolution fall back to the installed root's resolution inside their scope.

**No ambient Harper install:** a unit test must not depend on one. The Ubuntu `unit-test` job runs `harper install` before its suites; the Windows gate does not, and neither does a clean checkout — so a test that reads whatever config the machine happens to have is green on Ubuntu and red on Windows. Three suites hit exactly this: `harper_logger`/`logRotator` (no config means `logging.file` is off, and `createLogger({ path })` silently writes nothing), `globalIsolation` (`applications.allowedSpawnCommands` is empty, so `spawn('npm')` is rejected as a disallowed command), and `terminalShutdown` (`restartWorkers()` loads the root components, and `loadCertificates()` reads the config _file_, so it rejects with ENOENT — the harness pins a `ROOTPATH` as a fallback for this). Pin what the suite needs — `unitTests/logConfigFixture.js`, `env.setProperty()`, or a `ROOTPATH` pointed at a config the test writes — instead of reading it off the machine. `terminalShutdown`'s harness seeds `require.cache` with a no-op `loadRootComponents` (`terminalShutdownHarness.cjs`) to avoid its ~5,400-module (~34s Windows) top-level load.

**Test timing:** prefer condition-waits over fixed `delay(N)` sleeps. `await delay(N); assert(sideEffectHappened)` races against loaded runners and is the root cause of a class of flakiness (#1138). Use the shared `waitFor(condition, timeout?, interval?)` helper in `unitTests/waitFor.js` to poll until the actual condition holds. Reserve fixed sleeps for genuinely modeling elapsed time (TTL/expiry windows) or asserting a non-event (that something has _not_ happened yet). The same rule has a deploy-specific lever: `deploy_component` awaits the component's `install_command`, so an integration test that needs a deployment held in a non-terminal status parks it there with a fixture whose install command waits on a file (`integrationTests/deploy/stage-swap-availability.test.ts`, `integrationTests/deploy/qa701-deployment-payload-ops.test.ts`). Pacing the payload upload does not hold that window — whether the operation is dispatched before the request body finishes arriving is runtime-dependent, and under Bun it is not.

## Architecture

### Layers (top to bottom)

**Components** (`components/`)  
The plugin/application loader. Applications export a `handleApplication(scope)` function. `Scope` is the primary object passed to apps; it exposes:

- `scope.options` — `OptionsWatcher` for live-reloaded YAML config
- `scope.resources` — access to database tables and registered resources
- `scope.server` — the HTTP server handle

Files within a component are discovered via micromatch glob patterns and automatically mapped to URL paths.

**Server** (`server/`)  
Multiple HTTP entry points coexist:

- **Native layer** (`server/http.ts`) — direct socket handling for application-level HTTP/1.1, HTTPS, HTTP/2, and WebSockets in one path; highest performance. Most user traffic goes through here.
- **Operations API** (`server/operationsServer.ts`) — Fastify-based JSON operations API (`{operation: 'create_table', ...}`); internal/admin surface.
- **Custom Functions (legacy)** (`server/fastifyRoutes.ts`) — legacy Fastify autoload for user-defined routes. Don't add new code here.

All inbound protocols (REST, GraphQL, MQTT, NATS, WebSockets) eventually resolve to the same **Resource interface**. See `server/DESIGN.md` for the file-by-file map and the `http.ts` section index.

**Resources** (`resources/`)  
The universal abstraction. Everything that can be queried or mutated — database tables, caches, message topics, custom endpoints — extends `Resource` (`resources/Resource.ts`).

Static methods (`Resource.get`, `Resource.put`, `Resource.post`, `Resource.delete`, `Resource.patch`, `Resource.subscribe`) are the protocol entry points: the REST layer dispatches to the _class_ (`server/REST.ts`, inside a request-level `transaction()`), and the base implementations are `transactional()` wrappers that resolve an instance and delegate to the matching instance method. **New `Resource` subclasses here override instance methods** and leave the statics generic. Overriding a static entry point is a deliberate act that takes over the whole wrapper contract — including `data` resolution and the `allow*` gate — see `resources/DESIGN.md` → Conventions for the two obligations it saddles you with. Note this is _core's_ convention: the public [Harper best-practice skills](https://github.com/HarperFast/skills) tell **application** authors to implement REST verbs as statics on their own component resources; choose based on the situation.

`Table.ts` is the database table implementation (4744 lines, one giant `makeTable()` factory) — the most complex file in the codebase. **Use `resources/DESIGN.md` as a section index instead of reading top-to-bottom.**

**Data Layer** (`dataLayer/`)  
Legacy translation modules plus SQL translation (`sqlTranslator/`) via AlaSQL; these should be avoided. The storage engine is selectable via `HARPER_STORAGE_ENGINE=lmdb`.

**Configuration** (`config/`)  
YAML-based. `configUtils.js` parses config; `RootConfigWatcher.ts` enables hot reload. Environment variables override YAML values.

**Utility** (`utility/`)  
Logging, error types, helpers, async utilities. Most-used: `utility/hdbTerms.ts` (global constants), `utility/logging/harper_logger.js`, `utility/errors/hdbError.js`.

## Key Patterns

**`transactional()` wrapper** — All static Resource methods go through this. It ensures async operations run inside a database transaction. Use `contextStorage` (AsyncLocalStorage) to access the current transaction context without passing it explicitly.

**Resource discovery** — A component's config file maps glob patterns to URL paths. Files matching a pattern become routable resources automatically; no explicit route registration is needed.

**Lazy loading** — GraphQL, secure sandboxing, and tarball extraction are imported on demand. Do not add top-level imports for these modules. Every thread loads the startup module graph, so packages only some features need are also loaded on first use: lmdb (`require('lmdb')` where an LMDB environment is opened; type imports must be `import type`, since type stripping keeps `import { type X }` as a load), PKI.js/asn1js/easy-ocsp (only through `loadPkijs()`, which applies the Ed25519 patch first), node-forge, systeminformation and moment; lodash is imported per method (`lodash/cloneDeep.js`). `unitTests/server/startupDependencies.test.js` fails if one of the startup modules it loads (those that used to import them) loads one of them again. Source maps are off by default (`NODE_OPTIONS=--enable-source-maps` turns them on in every thread).

**TypeScript + type stripping** — Source files are `.ts` but Node.js runs them directly via type stripping in development. The `dist/` directory is the compiled production artifact. Both `.ts` and legacy `.js` files coexist; new code should be `.ts`.

**Minimal dependencies** — `dependencies.md` documents the rationale for every dependency. Adding a new dependency requires justification; implementing something ourselves is often preferred.

**An error's class name is its error code, and it is public** — Harper's error taxonomy (`ClientError`, `ServerError`, and the rest of `utility/errors/hdbError.ts`) is a contract clients code against: the class name is documented, clients branch on it, and it guides support. So `errorToString`'s `ClassName: message` rendering is deliberate wherever a client reads it — terminal HTTP error bodies (`server/http.ts`), REST WebSocket close reasons — and `streamErrorRecord` (`server/serverHelpers/contentTypes.ts`) publishes the class name in its own `error` field for the same reason. Do not "sanitize" it away as an internal implementation detail, and treat renaming an error class as a breaking change. What must not reach a client is an internal fault's _message_ — see `AUTHENTICATION_ERROR_MSGS.GENERIC_AUTH_FAIL`, which replaces the text while keeping the code.

## Git / Worktree Setup — Read Before Any Git Operation

This repo lives as a submodule of `harper-pro`. The submodule's git data directory is at
`../harper-pro/.git/modules/core/` (relative to this repo's root). That directory must contain
**only git metadata** — `objects/`, `refs/`, `config`, `HEAD`, etc.

**Known recurring failure mode:** If `../harper-pro/.git/modules/core/config` is ever absent or
replaced by a directory, git silently treats the git data dir as its own work tree. The next
`git checkout` deposits source files there — including a `config/` directory from the harper
source tree — which permanently shadows git's config file. Every subsequent agent then hits
`fatal: unknown error occurred while reading the configuration files` and the cycle repeats.

**Rules to prevent recurrence:**

- Never run `git submodule deinit core` + re-init from the `harper-pro` parent — it regenerates
  the module config without the required `core.worktree` setting.
- Never run `git checkout` or `git reset` while your working directory is inside
  `harper-pro/.git/modules/core/`.
- If you ever recreate `../harper-pro/.git/modules/core/config` from scratch, it **must** include:
  ```
  [core]
      worktree = ../../../core
  ```
- If you see source-tree files (e.g. `server/`, `resources/`, `config/`) appearing inside
  `../harper-pro/.git/modules/core/`, stop immediately and remove them — they are corrupting the
  git data directory.

---

## Non-Obvious Constraints

- `Resource` static methods must stay wrapped with `transactional()` — removing this breaks transaction isolation.
- Worker threads (`server/threads/`) receive `workerData.noServerStart = true` to prevent recursive server startup; never start the server inside a worker.
- `contextStorage` (AsyncLocalStorage) carries per-request context (user, transaction) across async boundaries — this is how authorization and transactions work without explicit parameter threading.
- SQL authorization (`verifyPermsAST` → `hasPermissions`) only checks the tables recorded in the statement bucket's affected-attribute map — it iterates that map, so a table missing from it is never checked, and an empty map authorizes by vacuous truth. Two rules follow. Resolve a table reference exactly once, through `sqlEngine/binder/defaultDatabase.ts`, so the authorization layer and the engine's binder cannot disagree about which `database.table` a bare name means. And when adding a new SQL construct, either record its table references in that map or make `getUnauthorizedTableRefs()` report them — an unrecorded reference is a permission bypass, not a missing feature (GHSA-5c29-q62v-jrwf).
- Tests under `unitTests/apiTests/` require the server to be stopped first (`node ./dist/bin/harper.js stop`) — `test:unit:apitests` does this automatically.
- Never assert on a fire-and-forget store write in the same turn that issued it. The engines disagree on read-your-writes: `PrimaryRocksDatabase` shows a pending `put` to a synchronous `getRange()`, `LMDBStore` shows it only after the commit lands (measured ~8 ms). `test:unit:resources` runs under both, so such an assertion passes locally and goes red on the `Unit tests: lmdb` leg alone. Poll with `unitTests/waitFor.js` instead — and where the property is "exactly once", no wait can establish it, so read the count from the producer (`onAnalyticsAggregate()` for aggregation cycles) rather than from storage.
- `@export` annotation on a schema class auto-generates a REST API for that table — this is the primary developer-facing API.
- Test style: write new unit tests with `assert` (the bare `node:assert` module) against real modules — **do not add new uses of `sinon` or `rewire`**. Use plain `assert`, **not** `node:assert/strict` — strict mode's deep-equality and coercion rules cause more friction and surprising failures than they prevent; plain `assert` is the house style. When a specific check genuinely needs strict/deep-strict semantics, call `assert.strictEqual`/`assert.deepStrictEqual` explicitly (both exist on plain `assert`) rather than importing `/strict`. This is lint-enforced: oxlint's `no-restricted-imports` rule rejects `node:assert/strict` and `assert/strict` imports. Older tests in `unitTests/security/` and `unitTests/utility/` still depend on them but they are not the target shape; match newer tests in `unitTests/config/*`, `unitTests/resources/*`, `unitTests/components/*`. If you can't write a test without stubbing, comment on the issue describing what's missing and stop — don't reach for sinon/rewire as a shortcut.
