# server/ — Navigation Guide

This layer accepts inbound traffic on every supported protocol (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTPS, WebSockets, MQTT, NATS) and routes it through to the Resource layer.

**Read this when:** you're touching request/response, protocol handling, middleware ordering, or WebSocket upgrade behavior.

> **Navigation convention.** This guide references code by **symbol name** (function/const). Use your editor's go-to-symbol or `grep -n '<name>' server/<file>` to jump. Line numbers drift; symbols don't.

## Three HTTP stacks coexist — know which one

| Stack                         | File                  | Used for                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Native**                    | `http.ts`             | Direct socket handling for application-level HTTP/1.1, HTTPS, HTTP/2, and WebSockets. Highest performance. This is the path most user requests take (REST, GraphQL, custom resource endpoints). |
| **Operations API**            | `operationsServer.ts` | Fastify-based JSON operations API (`{operation: 'create_table', ...}`). Internal/admin surface — not on the hot path for application data.                                                      |
| **Custom Functions (legacy)** | `fastifyRoutes.ts`    | Legacy custom functions only. Wraps Fastify with autoload. Don't add new code here.                                                                                                             |

A request entering `http.ts` does **not** go through Fastify unless no Harper handler answers it (status `-1` cascades to a registered Fastify instance). Of the two Fastify files only `fastifyRoutes.ts` has a `handleApplication(scope)`; `operationsServer.ts` is the `operationsApi` component, started once on the main thread through `startOnMainThread`.

| `Server.ts`                      | Defines the `Server` interface — the contract that protocol plugins use to register listeners. Has `socket()`, `http()`, `ws()`, `upgrade()`, `contentTypes`, `getUser()`, `operation()`, `replication`, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `http.ts`                        | Native HTTP/WS server. Registration entry points (`onRequest`, `onUpgrade`, `onWebSocket`), per-port middleware chains, UDS support, PROXY protocol. **See section map below.**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `middlewareChain.ts`             | Topological sort respecting `before`/`after` constraints on listener registrations (`topoSort`). Falls back to registration order on cycle. Also `urlPath`/`host` sub-route dispatch: a mount is a prefix with a segment boundary, the mount prefix is stripped from `request.pathname` before the sub-chain runs, and the root mount `'/'` normalizes to _no_ path constraint (joins the default chain, nothing stripped — #1766). |
| `REST.ts`                        | Resource-routed REST handler: URL → `Resource.getResource()` → method dispatch + content negotiation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### Operations & Fastify

| File                  | Purpose                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `operationsServer.ts` | Boots Fastify for operations API. `buildServer()` constructs the server; `handler()` parses `{operation: ...}` and dispatches. |
| `fastifyRoutes.ts`    | Legacy custom functions. Discovers routes from each component's `routes/` folder.                                              |

| `serverHelpers/sharedMessageEncoding.ts`   | Per-message encoding shared across the subscribers of a topic — one serialization per (message, content type) and, for MQTT QoS 0, one PUBLISH packet per (payload, topic, protocol version). Keyed on the message object, which `transactionBroadcast` dispatches by identity to every subscription of a key. **Identity contract:** see below.                                                                                                       |

Process-wide shutdown begins by calling `beginProcessShutdown()` in `threads/manageThreads.js`.
Once set, this terminal state prevents every worker replacement path and makes new `startWorker()`
calls fail with `ERR_HARPER_PROCESS_SHUTTING_DOWN`; scoped worker-type restarts do not set it.
`shutdownWorkersNow()` remains an immediate teardown: its worker shutdown messages are best-effort,
and it force-terminates the remaining worker set rather than waiting for application drain hooks.

A rolling restart serves the _old_ code until each worker is replaced, and where the OS grants
`SO_REUSEPORT` the not-yet-replaced workers keep accepting connections for the whole restart — so a
component deploy is not live pool-wide until `restartWorkers()` resolves. For the overlapping types
(HTTP) it waits for each replacement to report `CHILD_STARTED` — including the ones that can only be
started after their predecessor releases its exclusive ports (Windows/macOS/Bun) — and reports how
many workers it left on the old code because a replacement never came up, versus how many
replacements never started after their predecessor was already gone. Other thread types start their
replacement without being awaited. Each wait is bounded by a per-worker startup backstop, so
resolution means "the restart finished", not "every worker is new". A caller that treats its own success as
"the component is live" must await it (see `deployComponent` in `components/operations.js`).

> `index.ts` sets `workerData.noServerStart = true` when Harper is imported from a thread it did not spawn, so `threadServer.js` skips `startServers()` there; Harper's own HTTP workers start their servers.

### Where periodic maintenance runs (main thread vs last worker)

Single-instance background tasks pick their thread by what state they touch:

- **Last worker** (`ownsStoreMaintenance(storePath)` in `threads/manageThreads.js`: the last pool worker for shared stores; a dedicated isolated-application worker maintains only its own branch stores) — for tasks that operate on **worker-resident JS state**: audit cleanup (`resources/auditStore.ts`), TTL scans (`resources/Table.ts`) and disk reclamation (`storageReclamation.ts`) walk per-store objects that only exist in a worker.
- **Main thread** (`isMainThread`) — for tasks that drive a **process-global native singleton** and need no JS state. `transactionLogCooling.ts` is the example: rocksdb-js's transaction-log registry is one C++ static shared across all worker threads, so any thread cools every log. The main thread is chosen because it is the only thread that lives for the whole process — a worker-driven timer would stall whenever that worker is recycled.

| `registerUdsCleanupPaths`, `recordUdsBindSuccess`, `cleanupUdsFiles`, `markUdsBindFailed`, `writeUdsMetadata`, `cleanupSocketsDirectory`, `ensureSocketsDirectory` | UDS socket / metadata file lifecycle. The sockets directory is the access gate for these mirrors (they skip TLS and trust the PROXY v2 identity), so `ensureSocketsDirectory` forces it to `0700` at every creator (`http.ts`, `threadServer.js` Bun and raw TLS) before any registration. A shared worker that cannot secure it skips its mirror; an isolated worker, which has no other listener, throws. `writeUdsMetadata` publishes the yaml via `atomicWriteFile`, so readers never see a partial file. Ownership-aware: `recordUdsBindSuccess` captures the inode a worker's own bind confirmed; `cleanupUdsFiles`/`markUdsBindFailed` only unlink a path when the inode on disk still matches, so an overlapping restart's outgoing worker can never delete the replacement that already rebound the same path (see restartWorkers() in manageThreads.js). `cleanupSocketsDirectory` is the separate crash-path sweep, run once from `socketRouter.ts`'s `startHTTPThreads` on main-thread startup, before any worker can bind. |

### Middleware ordering (`before` / `after`)

Components register listeners with optional `before: 'name'` / `after: 'name'` options. `middlewareChain.topoSort` resolves order; cycles fall back to registration order with a warning. Three lists hold the registrations:

- `httpResponders` — request handlers
- `upgradeListeners` (in `http.ts`)
- `websocketListeners` (in `http.ts`)

The default WebSocket upgrade handler is registered automatically inside `onWebSocket()` the first time it runs for a given port.

**`port: 'all'` is a pseudo-port, and its chain is not the one that serves traffic.** Chain building
folds every `'all'` entry into each concrete port's chain, so `chains.all` exists but nothing
dispatches through it — `httpChain[port]`/`upgradeChains[port]`/`websocketChains[port]` are looked up
by the bound port on every request (Node, Bun, and uWS alike). A registration therefore has to
rebuild the chains it affects, not just its own key: `http.ts → buildChains()` rebuilds every
already-built chain of that kind whenever the registration is on `'all'`. Without that, an entry
registered on `'all'` after the concrete port's chain was built — the shape an application catch-all
mounted `after: 'rest'` takes, since `rest` registers first — updates only `chains.all` and never
reaches a request (#2418). Rebuilding is a pure function of the listener list and the port, so the
extra passes can only reproduce a port's order or extend it. `buildChains()` also writes the
`get_status` chain description in the same pass, which is what keeps that report from ever
describing an order a port isn't running (#1573).

### Application mounts (`host` / `urlPath` in the root config)

An operator mounts an application by putting `host`/`urlPath` on its entry in the **root** config; `components/scopeMount.ts` models it and the loader threads it into every `Scope` for that application (both load paths — the root-config `package` recursion and the components-root directory scan).

**The mount is applied at exactly one place: `Scope.routeFor()`, used by the `scope.server` proxy.** Do not push it anywhere else. In particular, do not compose it into the plugin config the entry pipeline reads: `entry.urlPath` is what `graphqlSchema` and `jsResource` derive **resource** paths from, and the router strips the mount _before_ REST resolves them. Composing it there registers a table at `/v1/Thing` while REST looks up `Thing`, and every mounted REST route 404s. A single-app `static` test will not catch it — static de-prefixes its own map keys, so it stays self-consistent either way.

Consequences worth knowing:

- Everything inside an application addresses itself **mount-relative**. Only two things need the absolute path: code that emits a URL back to the client (use `Scope.externalBasePath()` — static's redirect `Location`), and code that bypasses the routed chain (legacy fastify registers on the bare server, so its route prefix must be the full external path). `static.ts`'s mount-root redirect gates on the _external_ base path, not the plugin-local one — a root-level static plugin (`baseURLPath === '/'`) still needs the redirect when the application itself carries a mount, since the client-visible mount root is then `externalBaseURLPath`, not `/`.
- A plugin registering per-mount state must key it on `Scope.routeFor()`'s resolved route, not on the parts it composes from — distinct `(mount, pluginUrlPath)` pairs can flatten to the same string (`/a`+`bc` and `/ab`+`c`). `REST.ts`'s `startedMounts` does this; it replaced a process-global `started` flag that silently 404'd the second mounted application's REST API. `handleApplication` also closes over `resources`/`httpOptions` per call rather than a module-level var, and skips deploy pre-flight validation scopes (`scope.isTransientValidation`) entirely — registering handlers from a throwaway validation scope would splice a validation run into the live request path and permanently mark that mount started, silently skipping the real scope's later registration.
- A mount is routing, **not** isolation: exported resources stay instance-wide, and a `host` mount cannot constrain legacy fastify routes — `fastifyRoutes.ts` refuses to load (throws) rather than warn when a `host` mount is configured, since the fallback really is reachable on every host.
- An invalid mount (unparseable `host`/`urlPath`) fails the application **closed**: `componentLoader.tryRootConfigMount` skips loading it entirely rather than falling back to unmounted access — loading unconstrained would silently drop the isolation the operator asked for, which is worse than not loading at all.
- Two applications mounted at different routes can register same-named middleware (e.g. both enable `rest`) without colliding: `middlewareChain.resolveRoutedChains` resolves `before`/`after` name references against a registry scoped to that route's own group, falling back to a _global_ registry that only holds genuinely unmounted entries (e.g. `authentication`) — never another mounted route's entries.
- `host` matching reads `request.host` (Harper's `Request.host` getter), not the raw `Host` header — HTTP/2 clients send `:authority`, never `Host`, so reading the header directly silently 404s every host-mounted app under h2 while h1 keeps working. `hostnameFromHeader` also strips a trailing dot (`api.example.com.`, the absolute-FQDN form some resolvers emit) since it names the same origin.
- `scopeMount.normalizeMountHost` validates against the same grammar as the `deploy_component` operation's `host` field (bare DNS hostname or IPv6 literal) and throws otherwise, so a hand-typed root-config `host` with a port/scheme/path fails the application closed too, instead of loading it unreachably. `nestScopeMount` logs a warning when a child's `host` is discarded by the parent-authority rule, so that isn't silent.

## Operations authorization boundary

Operations request bodies are untrusted data. `serverHelpers/serverHandlers.js → handlePostRequest()` rejects
prototype-mutating property names and strips the legacy `bypass_auth` property before dispatch.
`serverUtilities.ts → chooseOperation()` never reads authorization control from the body: trusted
internal callers pass bypass state as a separate argument and expose it to operation handlers only
through `operationAuthorizationState.ts`'s async context. When an operation registered by a component
must run on a worker, `registeredOperations.ts` carries that state in the same-process ITC envelope,
separately from the structured-cloned body. Never attach trusted dispatch state to an operation
payload.

`server.registerOperation()` runs per-worker, so anything the **main** thread must later know about a
registered op has to ride the OPERATION_REGISTERED announcement — a module-local registry populated
during registration exists only in the worker that registered. The bridge carries two such facts
today: name→thread routing (for execution forwarding) and `grantable` (so `validateOperations` on
main will accept the name in a role's `operations` allowlist, for add_role/alter_role, impersonation,
and OIDC trust policies). Adding a third main-thread consumer of a worker-registered fact means
extending that message, not reading a registry that main never populated. Grantability is safe to
mirror because it only widens what an allowlist may _name_; enforcement stays on the worker's
`chooseOperation`.

## Resource ↔ HTTP boundary

`REST.ts → http(request, nextHandler)` is the chief integration point: it takes a `Request`, asks the `Resources` registry for a match, builds a `RequestTarget`, and dispatches into the Resource class's static method. Cache headers are translated to `request.expiresAt` / `onlyIfCached` / `noCache` flags within the same function.

### Streaming startup errors

SSE and NDJSON serializers eagerly take and hold their first iterator step for GET requests. `REST.ts` waits through the next event-loop turn for that step: an immediate rejection remains an HTTP error rendered as Problem Details, while a first item or the cutoff commits the stream. Mutating requests do not use the startup-status gate because their transaction has already committed by this point; all of their stream failures use the in-band form. Later GET failures are terminal, format-valid records (`event: harper-error` for SSE and a reserved control record for NDJSON). Keep the decision in the serializer/REST boundary so Node, uWS, Bun, compression, and injection share one contract; transports must not independently prefetch the iterator.

SSE terminal event data uses `{ error: <code-or-class>, message: <message>, status?: <status> }`; NDJSON wraps the same object as `{ "$harperStreamError": { ... } }` so it cannot be mistaken for an ordinary row with an `error` field.
Sources with `mapError` remain unmapped for these two formats so their failures reach this single contract instead of becoming legacy data records.
generic JSON-array streaming retains its older `{ error: "<name>: <message>" }` element shape.
The `error` value is the stable programmatic discriminator; `message` is diagnostic and follows the same thrown-message exposure policy as pre-commit Problem Details.

Clean stream completion does not prove completeness; clients must inspect SSE for the `harper-error` event and NDJSON for the `$harperStreamError` control record.

The operations API keeps the same line for a request refused before its progress stream starts (authentication, the role allowlist, validation): the Fastify `preSerialization` hook in `contentTypes.ts` answers an error-status reply that would negotiate `text/event-stream` as JSON, unless the route itself set `text/event-stream`. A stream payload never reaches that hook, which is how the progress stream (`progressEmitter.ts`) keeps its in-band `event: error` at status 200. The hook is shared with the legacy custom-functions server (`fastifyRoutes.ts`), whose untyped errors follow the same rule. `harper deploy` unwraps the unnamed frame older servers still send in that case.

### Deferred credential rejection (#2418)

`authentication` runs before route matching, so when it meets an `Authorization` header it cannot
resolve it does not yet know whether Harper or an application owns the URL. Rejecting there forces
an application to choose between two things it needs: Harper owning its own routes (status, REST
resources) and its own routes receiving their own credential scheme untouched.

So a rejection is recorded rather than answered:

- **Valid Harper credentials** authenticate normally and populate `request.user`. Unchanged.
- **No credentials** continue anonymously. Unchanged.
- **A syntactically valid credential Harper does not recognize** leaves `request.user` unset, leaves
  the inbound `Authorization` header byte-for-byte intact, and records request-local state through
  `security/deferredAuthentication.ts`. The state lives behind a module-private `Symbol`. Its
  descriptor and value are immutable and non-enumerable, so downstream middleware cannot clear it
  and it does not leak through request copies or serialization.
- **An internal authentication fault** — unreadable or malformed JWT key material, a storage failure,
  an unexpected error type — is never deferred, and fails closed with the in-line 401.
- **The operations API** never defers: `request.isOperationsServer` short-circuits to the in-line
  401, because every operations route is Harper-owned and there is nothing to defer to.

**Rejection provenance is asserted, never inferred.** `security/credentialRejection.ts` holds a
module-private `Symbol` tag; only the code that actually concludes "this credential is unacceptable"
sets it, and `isCredentialRejection()` reads nothing else. Status ranges cannot carry that meaning:
user resolution touches system-table searches (`listUsers()`) that raise a default-status-400
`ClientError` when `system.hdb_role`/`system.hdb_user` is unavailable, so a 4xx test would classify a
storage outage as an unknown credential and hand it to application authorization. The tag is set at
exactly these points:

| Tagged rejection                                                   | Where                                                                                        |

| a component's `server.getUser` override that tags its own error    | `markCredentialRejection` / `credentialRejectionError`, exported from `harper` (harper#2703) |

`validateToken()` separates the two in the same catch: `jsonwebtoken` reports unusable key material
through the very same `JsonWebTokenError` type it uses for a forged token, so the public key is
validated as key material before `jwt.verify()` runs and a residual key-material message is treated
as a fault. An untagged error propagates unmasked.

The Bearer path's refresh-token probe follows the same rule. When operation-token validation says
`invalid token`, authentication retries the credential as a refresh token; a fault raised by that
retry propagates, and only an ordinary _tagged_ refresh rejection restores the original
operation-token rejection for deferral. An in-line fail-closed response logs the original fault
server-side and returns the same generic authentication failure a rejected credential gets, so
internal detail never reaches an unauthenticated client.

Any layer that establishes Harper owns the route then settles the deferred state before doing work:

**Every Harper-owned handler registered `after: 'authentication'` owes this settlement**, because
declining to call `nextHandler` is precisely the moment ownership is settled. A handler that skips
it serves an unrecognized credential as anonymous — the MCP application mount did exactly that, and
returned 200 for an `initialize` the base revision answered with 401.

Settlement goes through `settleDeferredCredentialRejection()`, which returns the response descriptor
`security/auth.ts` used to return in line: status 401 and `serializeMessage({error: message}, request)`
in the request's negotiated content type. That matters because an owner's own error mapping is not
that contract — REST renders a thrown error as an RFC 9457 Problem Details document and GraphQL as
`{errors:[{message}]}` — and a rejected credential never reached either before deferral existed.
`assertNoDeferredCredentialRejection()` is the throwing form, for a WebSocket upgrade that has no
descriptor to return. A WebSocket owner cannot read the state synchronously: `server/http.ts` starts
`httpChain[port](request)` and invokes the WebSocket chain with the still-pending completion, so
authentication has not yet classified the credential. `mqtt.ts` therefore settles on that promise —
the same one the session's principal resolves from — and closes the socket from its rejection, while
its frame handlers still attach synchronously. The deferred status is pinned to 401 regardless of the underlying error's own
status, so a 403 `token expired` reads exactly as it did before. A Harper-owned route therefore behaves identically to the pre-deferral
build, protected or public: an unknown credential can never buy access an anonymous caller would
have received, and can never reach an application catch-all. Only a URL that reached
`nextHandler` — one no Harper route owns — carries the original header onward.

The contract is route-ownership-based, not path-based. There is no exemption list, no carrier
header, no credential rename, and no pre-auth stripping shim.

**Authentication does not re-decorate a 401 it did not raise.** `security/auth.ts` post-processes any
401 coming back up the chain — overwriting `WWW-Authenticate` with `Basic`, or rewriting the status to
a 302 at `resources.loginPath` for a browser. The in-line rejection deferral replaced returned before
that code, so a settled rejection must skip it to stay wire-identical; and a 401 an application
catch-all raised for its own scheme (a WooCommerce or Bearer challenge) is that application's to make.
Both cases are keyed on the deferred state, so a request that deferred nothing keeps the existing
behavior exactly. The #1565 identity floor still applies either way — it is stamped in
`applyResponseHeaders`, not in the challenge rewriting.

**The identity cache floor survives the legacy Fastify fallbacks.** A response produced under a
deferred credential is credential-dependent (#1565), so `authentication` stamps
`Cache-Control: private, no-cache` and `Vary: Authorization, Cookie` on it. Before deferral an
unrecognized credential could not reach a fallback at all, so this was unreachable. All three adapters
now reconcile through one policy, `Headers.ts → mergeChainHeadersIntoFallback()`: Fastify wins every
single-valued header it set, `Vary` is unioned, and the private scope is re-applied unless the final
response explicitly opts into shared caching (`public`/`s-maxage`).

`Set-Cookie` is the deliberate exception to Fastify-wins. It is a list-valued field, so the chain's
cookies are appended beside Fastify's and de-duplicated by exact value, never by cookie name. A cookie
is identified by name _plus_ `Domain` _plus_ `Path` (RFC 6265 §5.3), so collapsing by name drops
legitimately distinct cookies — a same-name pair scoped to `/` and `/wp-admin`, or a `Max-Age=0`
deletion paired with a set. Exact value is also what makes Node's `writeHead` re-merge idempotent,
because that path sees the chain's own cookie already on the response. Two cookies that do share a
full identity both reach the client, chain last, and the user agent resolves them last-wins.

Bun and uWS rebuild their headers from Fastify's reply and merge once. Node hands Fastify the same
`ServerResponse` the chain's headers were copied onto, so copying is not enough — a route calling
`reply.header('Cache-Control', …)` replaces the floor outright and can make a credential-dependent
response shared-cacheable. `bridgeChainHeadersToNodeResponse()` therefore runs the same merge from a
`writeHead` interception, the last point the header set is still mutable and the one Node also routes
implicit headers through.

### Response Cache-Control / Vary policy (#1518, #1565)

Three tiers, applied in two places:

1. **App/resource explicit** — a `Cache-Control` set by the resource (or `@table(cacheControl: "...")` for anonymous reads, emitted in `REST.ts → http()`) always wins. The declaration is required: anonymous readability alone never emits shared-cache headers, because a request-attribute-gated `allowRead` (IP, headers) would make inferred `public` unsound.
2. **Identity floor** — `security/auth.ts → applyResponseHeaders` stamps `Cache-Control: private, no-cache` + `Vary: Authorization` (+ `Cookie` when sessions are on) on any response where a principal was resolved, credentials were rejected (401), or a credential rejection was deferred (#2418 — the application answered using the header Harper passed through, so the response is credential-dependent at a plain 200), _unless_ the app opted into shared caching with `public`/`s-maxage` (the RFC 9111 opt-in).
3. **CORS partitioning** — when CORS is enabled, every response gets `Vary: Origin` (the ACAO header is reflected per-origin, and its absence on no-Origin requests is origin-dependent too).

The `@table(cacheControl:)` value is persisted on the primary-key attribute (like `expiration`), so all threads and future boots see it; `resources/databases.ts → table()` treats `null` as "schema explicitly has none" (clears on reload) and `undefined` as "caller is not schema-defining" (no clobber from `add_attribute`/cluster schema events).

## Conventions

- Don't add new code to `fastifyRoutes.ts` — it's the legacy custom-functions path.
- New protocol plugins register through the `Server` interface (`Server.ts`): `server.http()`/`request()`/`ws()`/`upgrade()` (bound to `http.ts`'s `httpServer`/`onRequest`/`onWebSocket`/`onUpgrade`) and `server.socket()` (`threadServer.js → onSocket`).
- Always pass `name` when registering a listener with `before`/`after` — anonymous entries can't be ordered against.
- Tests live in `../unitTests/server/`.

## The dispatched API operation is carried on async context, never on the request (`server/serverHelpers/operationAuthorizationState.ts`)

`verifyPermsAST`'s token-scope check has to be told which top-level API operation the caller
invoked, because the scope is written in that namespace (`sql`, `export_local`, ...). Two things
make that awkward:

1. On the **direct-SQL** path, the object handed to `checkASTPermissions` _is_ the client's request
   body, and this check is the only table and token-scope gate there (`chooseOperation`'s `sql` branch
   is mutually exclusive with its `verifyPerms` call; only `verifyOperationsAllowlist` also runs). Any field read off that object is therefore a way to
   name whichever operation the caller's scope happens to allow and run arbitrary SQL under it.
   `jsonMessage.operation` is safe only because dispatch already routed on that same field, so it
   cannot disagree with the operation running. Never add another.
2. A **job** re-parses its SQL from the nested `search_operation` in a _different_ async context —
   `executeJob` persists the request and hands off to the job runner, and `jobs/jobProcess.ts` re-enters
   from the `hdb_job` record. So a store established around the originating request cannot reach
   it, and the re-parse would be judged as `sql` rather than as the job's own operation.

The carrier is therefore established **in the job worker**, by `runWithDispatchedOperation`, from
the same `request.operation` that `getOperationFunction` just resolved the handler from. That
identity is the whole basis for trusting it: the value naming the operation and the value selecting
the code cannot diverge. A new carrier must preserve that property — an added request property, a
`search_operation` field, or a persisted `parsed_sql_object` would not.

This lives in the same `AsyncLocalStorage` as the auth bypass rather than a second store, so
`processAST` reads the state once. `runWithOperationAuthorizationBypass` **preserves** an existing
carrier on both branches. That is deliberate and was initially got wrong: its enforced branch is not
a bypass, so a job handler dispatching a nested _authorized_ operation lands there, and dropping the
carrier would judge that job's re-parsed SQL as the inner `sql` and refuse it partway through its own
work. The consequence to know is the other direction — a nested dispatch inside a job is judged
against the **outer** job's operation for any `evaluateSQL` that does not pass through
`chooseOperation`. It allocates only when a carrier is present; with none, two shared frozen objects
serve the common path. All four stores are frozen, so `getOperationAuthorizationState()` cannot hand
a mutable one to a caller.

It has four call sites, and they are not all dispatch wrappers: `server.operation()`
(`serverUtilities.ts`), the ITC path (`registeredOperations.ts`), the legacy SQL engine
(`sqlEngine/diff/differential.ts`), and Harper's own `hdb_job` query (`server/jobs/jobs.ts`) — that
last one **is** reached from the ops-API dispatch, via `search_jobs_by_start_date` →
`handleGetJobsByStartDate` → `getJobsInDateRange`.

Harper's own internal SQL takes the bypass, not the carrier. `getJobsInDateRange` runs a fixed
`system.hdb_job` query through `evaluateSQL` beneath a handler the caller was already authorized for,
and `SqlSearchObject` hardcodes `operation: 'sql'` — so the same mismatch applies, but the answer
differs, and the reason is easy to get backwards. `verifyPermsAST`'s super_user early return is
`isSuperUser && !isSuSystemOperation`, so a `system` schema is **exempt** from it and the table check
genuinely runs. A carrier would therefore put Harper's own query through `hasPermissions` on
`system.hdb_job`, which passes only because `appendSystemTablesToRole` grants `system.*.read` to a
hydrated super_user — a super_user principal without an appended `permission.system` (an
impersonation payload, or any user not resolved through `security/user.ts`) would start getting 403s on an
operation it is entitled to. The bypass also states the actual intent: the statement is Harper's, not
the caller's. Wrap the individual statement, not the function — a later caller-dependent statement
must not inherit it.

A second body field has to be neutralized for any of this to hold: `evaluateSQL` trusts a supplied
`parsed_sql_object` verbatim and skips parsing, `chooseOperation` overwrites only the **top-level**
one, and `dataLayer/export.ts` hands the nested `search_operation` straight to `evaluateSQL`. So a
body-supplied `search_operation.parsed_sql_object` carrying `permissions_checked: true` would run an
arbitrary AST with the check skipped. `chooseOperation` deletes it, forcing the worker to re-parse
from the `sql` string that dispatch authorized — the nested object is never overwritten the way the
top-level one is, because nothing downstream should read one at all.

What is untestable is not the carrier's contract — unit tests cover that by calling
`runWithDispatchedOperation` directly — but that `jobProcess` is what establishes it. Delete that call
and those tests stay green. The carrier only changes an outcome through `tokenScopeDenial`, which is
inert unless the principal carries `tokenOperations`, and that property has exactly one origin: an
OIDC trust-policy exchange, for which there is no integration harness.

Three different mechanisms are easy to conflate here. `tokenOperations` above is the **OIDC token
operation scope** (#2174). An **inline-role scoped token** (`create_authentication_tokens` with a
`role` object) is not the same thing and cannot substitute, because `createScopedToken` mints it
`super_user: false`, so it cannot invoke a `requires_su` operation such as `export_local` at all.
**Table permissions** are a third, and also cannot substitute — see the system-schema exemption
above. See #2298.

## `universalHeaders` (`http.securityHeaders`): ownership, precedence, and per-thread scope

`server/http.ts` exports `universalHeaders: [string, string][]`, applied to responses in the
Node, Bun, and uWS (`#914`, `HARPER_UWS_HTTP`) request handlers alike. `http.securityHeaders`
config populates it via `applySecurityHeaders()`, called from `handleApplication()` on load and
on `scope.options.on('change', ...)`. Three invariants to preserve:

- **Ownership tracking.** Other components may push entries onto the same shared array, so a
  hot-reload can't clear-and-rebuild it. `applySecurityHeaders` tracks the exact `[name, value]`
  tuples it previously pushed in a module-level `ownedSecurityHeaders` array and splices only
  those out (by reference, via `indexOf`) before re-adding the new set. Any future feature that
  pushes into `universalHeaders` from a hot-reloadable source should follow the same "track what
  I added, only remove what I added" pattern.
- **Root scope owns the config.** `'http'` is a `TRUSTED_RESOURCE_PLUGINS` key, so an application
  `config.yaml` with an `http:` block re-invokes `handleApplication`. A module-level guard makes
  only the _first_ invocation (the root config, which loads before applications) own
  `applySecurityHeaders` and its change listener; later invocations still refresh `httpOptions`
  but cannot wipe root-configured headers.
- **App wins on conflicts.** Universal headers are _defaults_: `applyUniversalHeaders()` (a shared
  helper used by all three transports) only sets a header when `has(name)` is false, and the
  direct-to-`nodeResponse` paths (handlesHeaders, error) check `hasHeader` first. A route that sets
  `X-Frame-Options: DENY` is never loosened by a configured `SAMEORIGIN`. Response paths covered:
  normal writeHead, `handlesHeaders` streams (e.g. the static component's `send()`, which writes
  its own headers directly — universal headers are pre-set on `nodeResponse` / the Bun
  `responseHeaders` shim so the stream can still override its own names), the thrown-error path,
  and the `status === -1` cascade — on Node via the Fastify `'unhandled'` event bridge, on Bun/uWS
  via `injectToFastify` (or the bare-404 fallback when no Fastify instance is registered for the
  port). Each `status === -1` branch builds a **fresh** `Headers` object from the fallback
  response rather than reusing the request's original `headers`, so `applyUniversalHeaders()` must
  be called again on whichever object actually gets returned — applying it only once, before the
  `status === -1` branch, is a trap that silently drops universal headers on every unhandled/404
  response. CI first caught this on the uWS shard (the integration suite's only unauthenticated
  404 case landed there); the same bug existed unnoticed on Bun's parallel `status === -1`
  branches (`getBunHTTPServer`'s bare-404 return and `bunDelegateToNodeServer`'s two `Response`s)
  and is fixed alongside it in #1568.

**Why the operations API doesn't get these headers in normal mode**: ops requests _do_ flow
through the Harper-native `requestHandler` (`httpServer()` calls `getServer()` for every
registration, including Fastify's non-function listener) and cascade to Fastify via the
`status === -1` branch, which copies `response.headers` onto `nodeResponse`. But the ops API runs
on the **main thread**, and the main thread loads components with `resources.isWorker = false`
(`server/loadRootComponents.js`), so the componentLoader's `resources.isWorker &&
extensionModule.handleApplication` gate (`components/componentLoader.ts`) means http's
`handleApplication` never runs there — the main thread's `universalHeaders` array stays empty.
`universalHeaders` is per-thread module state, populated only where the http component loads.
Corollary: with `threads: 0` the ops API shares the worker where `handleApplication` _did_ run,
so ops responses **will** carry the headers there (benign).

## Under Bun, the main HTTP port is served by `node:http`, not `Bun.serve`

Worth knowing before debugging anything Bun-specific on the HTTP path: `getBunHTTPServer()` builds
the `Bun.serve()` fetch config, but `onWebSocket()` calls `getHTTPServer()` unconditionally — it has
a uWS branch and no Bun branch, because Bun native WebSockets are unimplemented (nothing ever sets
`config.websocket`, so WS relies on the Node `ws` server attached to an `http.Server`). MQTT's
`handleApplication` registers WS on the default port before REST's `httpServer()` call for that same
port, so `httpServers[port]` is already a Node server by then and `getBunHTTPServer` early-returns
without registering a serve config. The port is bound by `registerServer()`'s Node server via
`listenOnPortsBun`'s trailing "non-HTTP servers" loop, and the fetch handler is never invoked for it
(only the exclusive operations port reaches `Bun.serve`). Consequence: on Bun the `Request`/`Response`
fetch path is dead code for the main port, and its divergences show up as `node:http`-emulation
divergences instead.

One such divergence, `#2210`: Bun's `node:http` never derives keep-alive from the request. For a
`Connection: close` request `shouldKeepAlive` stays `true`, and neither a `Connection: close` response
header nor `response.socket.end()` closes the connection — a **stream-ended** response (an async
source ended through `pipeline()`; a direct `response.end()` is fine) delivers its full body and
terminal chunk, then holds the connection until Bun's own idle timeout — a chunked-aware client
completes the message and can walk away, but the un-honored close still violates RFC 9112 §9.6 and
strands the socket; a raw client waiting on the FIN (and the HTTP/1.0 case below, which has no
terminal chunk to stop at) hangs outright. An HTTP/1.0 client hangs the same way
without asking to close at all, since 1.0 persistence needs both an explicit `keep-alive` and a length
to read to — so a 1.0 response that got no `Content-Length` is close-delimited, the same line Node
draws (Node closes it at ~7ms; Bun never does). An explicit `close` token wins over `keep-alive` on
both versions. A 1.0 `keep-alive` request whose response _did_ get a
`Content-Length` (`body.size` on a blob — the `body instanceof Blob` branch of `getHTTPServer`'s request handler) is left open, which is again what
Node does and what Bun then handles correctly.

`pipeBodyToResponse()` therefore ends `request.socket` itself for those shapes
(`endConnectionIfClientExpectsClose`, `isBun`-gated, HTTP/1 only, clean path only — the error path
already closes because `pipeline()` destroys the response with the stream error). Ending the
_request's_ socket is the only remedy that works after a clean stream end on Bun: a `Connection:
close` response header, `response.socket.end()` and `response.destroy()` were all measured as no-ops
there. `socket.end()` is graceful, so it does not truncate — 8 MB over plain TCP and 6 MB over TLS to
a deliberately slow reader each arrive whole. The
`Content-Length` check reads `response.hasHeader()`, which Bun populates from the `writeHead(status,
headers)` fast path this file uses (Node does not, but the branch is Bun-only). A
keep-alive arm pins the other direction (such a client keeps its connection and reuses it); the two
HTTP/1.0 arms are Node/Bun-only, because uWS does not route an HTTP/1.0 request to the resource at
all.

## Per-worker UDS mirrors are separate server instances — port-keyed wiring does not reach them (`server/http.ts`)

With `tls.unixDomainSockets: true`, every secure port gets a per-worker cleartext mirror
(`<worker>-<port>.sock`) so a fronting proxy (symphony) can terminate TLS and route to a specific
worker. The mirror is a **separate** `http.Server` instance registered in `SERVERS[udsPath]` — it is
_not_ `httpServers[port]` — so anything wired by port key (upgrade listeners, uWS `wsHandler`,
mTLS flags, socket options) must be explicitly propagated to it. `getHTTPServer()` exposes the
mirror as `server.udsMirror` (Node) / `server.udsMirrorUwsConfig` (HARPER_UWS_UDS) for exactly this;
`onWebSocket()` uses those to attach the `'upgrade'` dispatch and uWS `wsHandler`. Two lessons paid
for in production (WS handshakes died with a zero-byte close on the mirrors while SSE worked):

- A Node HTTP server with **no** `'upgrade'` listener destroys upgrade sockets with no response and
  no log — a silent per-server default that makes a missing listener look like a network problem.
- `enableProxyProtocol()`'s data interception must hand the socket **back to the original
  listeners** once the PROXY header decision is made (it re-attaches them and removes its wrapper).
  A permanent wrapper breaks protocol handoffs: Node's upgrade path removes its parser's `'data'`
  listener _by reference_ before ws takes over, so a lingering wrapper keeps feeding the freed HTTP
  parser — which the parser pool can re-issue to another connection, injecting one connection's
  WS frames into another's request stream (`Parse Error: Data after 'Connection: close'`).

The h2c mirror (`HARPER_H2C_UDS`) is exempt: HTTP/1.1 `Upgrade` doesn't exist in h2, and the
fronting proxy routes WS to the h1 mirror by ALPN.

Known limitation on uWS-served transports (`HARPER_UWS_HTTP` ports, `HARPER_UWS_UDS` mirrors):
uWS accepts WebSocket handshakes natively in `app.ws()`, so `server.upgrade()` middleware never
runs pre-handshake there (auth is unaffected — it runs in the WS connection chain on both paths,
matching Node's upgrade-then-authorize order). No core component registers custom upgrade
middleware; `onUpgrade()`/`installUwsWsHandler()` warn when one is registered for a uWS-served
port so the gap is visible instead of silent.

## A per-thread UDS mirror is bound at a temp name and renamed over its published path (`server/threads/threadServer.js`)

libuv unlinks a pipe server's bound path when the handle closes (`uv__pipe_close` → `unlink`), with
no check of who owns the path now. On Linux `restartWorkers()` pre-starts the replacement worker
while the outgoing one still runs (#1417), and both publish the same `<worker>-<port>.sock`. Bound
directly at that path, the replacement rebinds it and the outgoing worker's `closeServers()` then
deletes the replacement's socket — Harper's own `cleanupUdsFiles()` is inode-ownership-aware
(#2035) and skips it, but libuv's unlink ran after that and removed every mirror on every rolling
restart (#2961). So `listenOnDomainSocket()` binds a mirror (`server.isPerThreadSocket`) at
`.<threadId>.<seq>` in the sockets directory and `renameSync()`s it over the published path:
`rename()` keeps the listening inode, so the close-time unlink only ever targets a temp name that
no longer exists, and the published path is never absent between an unlink and a bind.

- `recordUdsBindSuccess(publishedPath)` runs after the rename, so the identity it records is the
  inode that is listening; `cleanupUdsFiles()`'s ownership guard is unchanged and is now the only
  thing that removes a mirror's published file. The regression and the shutdown sequence are
  covered by `unitTests/server/threads/threadServerListenOnPorts.test.js`; the real rolling restart
  by `integrationTests/server/uds-mirror-overlapping-restart.test.ts`.
- The temp name is unique per process (`threadId` never repeats; `seq` is per thread); both it and
  the published path are checked with `isDomainSocketPathTooLong`, and an overlong one takes the
  existing fail-soft branch rather than falling back to a direct bind; it never matches a proxy's
  `*-<port>.yaml`/`.sock` discovery; a leftover from a crash is swept by `cleanupSocketsDirectory()`
  before any worker binds.
- The operations API's primary domain socket keeps the direct bind on purpose: `bin/cliOperations.ts`
  reads that file's presence as "Harper is running", so its unlink on close is load-bearing.
- The uWS mirror (`HARPER_UWS_UDS`) keeps its direct bind: measured on uWebSockets.js 20.68.0,
  `app.close()` never unlinks a `listen_unix` path, so it is not exposed. Bun restarts are
  non-overlapping, so the Bun mirror is not exposed either.

## A worker that misses an ITC ack gets its OS thread state logged (`server/threads/manageThreads.js`)

`broadcastWithAcknowledgement` already times out (30 s) on a worker whose port stays open but never acks, and that shape is almost always a blocked event loop — a native lock, a runaway synchronous call — which nothing inside the worker can report (harper-pro#788: a restarted node's single http worker went byte-silent while main kept serving `cluster_status`, and the app log only said "not acknowledged by worker thread(s) 2"). So each worker posts its Linux thread id (`readlink /proc/thread-self`) to main once at startup, before anything else runs on it, and the timeout branch reads that thread's kernel state from `/proc/self/task/<tid>`: state, `wchan`, the syscall number (the first token only — the rest of that file is argument registers and stack/instruction pointers), CPU ticks, and context-switch counts, plus two cross-platform signals main already has, `worker.performance.eventLoopUtilization()` and the age of the last 1 s resource report. It samples again a second later and logs the deltas: no CPU ticks, no context switches and `event loop active +1000ms` is "parked on a lock"; ticks climbing with state `R` is "spinning". It is deliberately main-thread-only and best-effort: `workers` and the tid live on the main thread's `Worker` objects, every `/proc` field is reported individually (a hardened container may deny `wchan`/`syscall` while `stat` stays readable), a follow-up sample whose `starttime` differs from the first is discarded (the tid may have been recycled), one diagnostic runs per worker with a 30 s cooldown so concurrent timeouts on the same worker don't multiply reads, and nothing here runs when acks arrive on time. It does not name the lock owner; that still needs a native stack from the next occurrence.

That diagnostic is reactive — it only fires once something else (an ITC ack) has already timed out. `sampleWorkerELU`, run from the same 1 s monitoring tick that already computes `recentELU`, is the proactive counterpart: it warns as soon as a worker's `eventLoopUtilization()` stays `>= 0.99` for `PINNED_ELU_SUSTAINED_TICKS` (30) consecutive ticks, and warns once more on recovery. State (`pinnedELUTicks`, `pinnedELUWarned`) lives on the `Worker` object, so a replaced worker starts a clean streak, and a single tick below threshold resets it — no partial credit across a dip. The very first sample after a worker (re)starts is skipped: `worker.performance.eventLoopUtilization()` called with no prior baseline returns the worker's whole-lifetime total, not a 1 s delta, so counting it could misattribute pre-tick startup work as a pinned tick. That baseline check requires a nonzero `idle` or `active` on the prior sample, not just a prior sample existing: before a worker's loop is online, `eventLoopUtilization()` returns a truthy-but-empty `{ idle: 0, active: 0 }`, and treating that as a real baseline would let the following tick's delta span the same whole-lifetime window. Bun has no `eventLoopUtilization()` and reports a placeholder `{ utilization: 0 }` instead (see `sampleWorkerELU`'s Bun branch), so this warning is Node-only. A worker tearing down can briefly report `idle < 0`, putting `utilization` outside `[0, 1]`; that tick is treated as unmeasured — neither counted nor a streak reset — rather than logging an absurd percentage or ending an episode early. Both log lines name the worker by thread id plus `name`/`application` (e.g. a job or isolated-application worker), since a legitimately saturated worker looks identical to a wedged one from ELU alone; this warns on saturation regardless of cause; distinguishing "busy" from "stuck" is left to the operator.

## A worker's `parentPort` close is not the main thread's exit (`server/threads/manageThreads.js`)

`REMOVE_PORT {threadId}` and the `onThreadExit` listeners (database-drop owner release, deploy lifecycle, registered operations, log rotation) act on a thread's death. A sibling port's `close` is taken as the far thread's exit. A worker's `parentPort` carries `threadId = 0` so lookups can route to main, but its `close` means this worker is leaving: main's exit ends the process. `addPort`'s close listener therefore passes no dead thread id for `parentPort`. Announcing one would make every sibling fail its pending acks to main, drop its own `parentPort`, and fire exit listeners for main. Regression cover: `unitTests/server/threads/stuckWorkerDiagnostics.test.js`, "does not report the main thread as exited to a sibling of a worker that closes its parentPort".

## `chooseOperation` authorizes the invoked operation against the authenticated principal (`server/serverHelpers/serverUtilities.ts`)

`verifyPerms` takes a request-shaped object and reads _both_ halves of the permission question off it: the principal from `hdb_user`, and the tables from `schema`/`database`/`table`/`records`. `chooseOperation` used to hand it `json.search_operation` — a caller-supplied field — which made both halves body-controlled. Fixing one half and not the other is not a fix: with an empty `search_operation` the table map is empty, and `hasPermissions` iterating nothing authorizes everything. Regression cover: `integrationTests/security/choose-operation-authz.test.ts`.

Four rules hold this together, and all four are load-bearing:

**The principal comes from authentication.** Authentication sets only the _top-level_ `hdb_user`, and `validateRequestBodyProperties` inspects only top-level keys, so a nested `hdb_user` must be overwritten, never backfilled `if (!...)`. All four callers of `chooseOperation` (`serverHandlers`, `serverUtilities.operation`, `registeredOperations` worker forwarding, MCP) set the top-level principal before dispatch, which is why this belongs here rather than only at the HTTP boundary.

**`search_operation` is the permission subject only for the operations that consume it.** `dataLayer/export.ts` is its sole consumer (`export_local`, `export_to_s3`); for any other operation the substitution checks the nested tables while the handler runs against the top-level ones, so it is gated on the operation name. It must also be an object naming one of export's supported operations (`search_by_value`/`search_by_hash`/`search_by_conditions`/`sql`) — a primitive, `{}`, or an unsupported operation is a request-time 400, not a wrapped 500 or an asynchronously-failed job.

**One check cannot authorize both the outer export and its nested query.** The outer op's own `verifyPerms` returns before any table check — `export_local`/`export_to_s3` are `requires_su`, and a role that lists the operation in `operations` is granted at gate 2 (an explicit listing of an SU-only operation is a deliberate grant). The job worker then runs `search_operation` through `searchByValue`/`searchByHash`/`searchByConditions`, none of which check permissions. So the outer invocation is authorized first, and then the nested search is authorized additively against its _real_ search handler (`getOperationFunction(search_operation)`) and the authenticated principal — otherwise a role granted `export_local` could export a table it holds no grant on. A nested `sql` search takes the SQL branch instead, but the same two-part shape holds: the outer export op runs through `verifyPerms` (so its `requires_su` gate, the `operations` allowlist, and the export token scope all apply, exactly as on the non-SQL path — SQL must not be a way around the requires_su gate), the statement must be a `SELECT` because export is read-only, and `checkASTPermissions` then covers the statement's tables. A direct `sql` call has no outer job op, so there the `operations` allowlist alone is the operation-invocation check.

**`parsed_sql_object` is dispatch state, never client input.** The export worker re-reads it off the same caller-supplied nested object (`evaluateSQL`), and it carries `permissions_checked`, so a body-supplied one runs an AST no check ever saw. It is deleted from the nested object at dispatch, and stripped from the top-level object before this dispatch's own parse is assigned. Only the direct-SQL path consumes the top-level `parsed_sql_object`; a job re-parses off `search_operation`, so setting it for a job would be inert. The bypass/`apiOperation` decision is carried on async-context state (`getOperationAuthorizationState`), not on the request body, and `processAST` honors the denial `checkASTPermissions` computes — a `PermissionResponseObject` has no `length`, so the guard tests the object itself rather than `.length` (which always refused nothing).

The SQL and job paths are additive rather than exclusive: `verifyPermsAST` validates only the statement's tables and attributes, never the `operations` allowlist or `requires_su`, and a table-free statement gives it nothing to validate — so the allowlist check and the AST check both run for a SQL-carrying request, and the nested-search check runs alongside the outer export check for a job.

## `withNodeAdapter()`'s response is the body `PassThrough` it resolves with (`server/serverHelpers/NodeAdapterResponse.ts`)

`Request.withNodeAdapter(handler)` gives third-party Node middleware an `IncomingMessage`/`ServerResponse` pair and resolves `{ status, headers, body }` once headers are committed. The response is `NodeAdapterResponse extends PassThrough`, and that same stream is the resolved `body`: `write()`'s return value, `'drain'`, `'finish'`, `'close'`, `writableEnded`/`writableFinished` and destroy propagation are Node's own rather than events forwarded from a second stream, which is what `Readable.pipe`, `compression`'s buffered `res.on('drain')` and Next.js's response writer depend on past the high-water mark (#2527). Invariants that middleware exercises and the unit test `unitTests/server/serverHelpers/nodeAdapterMiddleware.test.js` pins against the real `compression` 1.8 (its `compression-1.7` arm, meant for the 1.7.4 that Next.js vendors, has resolved to 1.8.2 since #2877, so 1.7.4 is currently untested), `send`, `on-finished` and `on-headers`:

- **Headers commit exactly once, through `this.writeHead`.** `write()`, `end()`, `flushHeaders()` and `_implicitHeader()` all reach `this.writeHead(this.statusCode)` by property lookup, so a `writeHead` that `on-headers` replaced on the instance runs its listeners (the ones that set `Content-Encoding` and remove `Content-Length`) before the promise resolves. After commit, `setHeader`/`appendHeader`/`removeHeader` and a second `writeHead` throw `ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT` as Node's do; `_header` (which `compression` ≤ 1.7 tests instead of `headersSent`) and `finished` (which `on-finished` tests) derive from that state.
- **The adapter owns the `'error'` listener.** A `destroy(err)` right after `writeHead()` emits before the awaiting caller can attach one; the error stays in the stream's `errored` state for `pipeline()`, `finished()` or async iteration. Client disconnect (`Request.signal`) destroys the response without an error after headers (a plain premature close, which `pipeBodyToResponse` treats as routine) and rejects the promise with the abort reason before them; a handler that throws or rejects before ending the response destroys it, and one that fails after `end()` is logged at warn.
- **Header names are case-insensitive on removal too.** `Headers.delete` lowercases like `set`/`get`/`has`; the inherited `Map.delete` silently left `send`'s `Content-Length` on a gzip body (truncated transfers).
- **Express is not a target.** `express`'s `app.handle()` replaces the response's prototype with one rooted at `http.ServerResponse.prototype`, which no Writable-derived response survives, and would do the same to the request `Proxy`'s target, Harper's real `IncomingMessage`. Middleware that duck-types the response (Next.js, `compression`, `send`, `serve-static`, `finalhandler`, h3, fastify) is the supported surface.

## `manageThreads` has two different `workerCount`s (`server/threads/manageThreads.js`)

The module-global `let workerCount` and the per-worker `workerData.workerCount` share a name and
nothing else. `getWorkerCount()` (and therefore the `server.workerCount` a component reads) resolves
only `workerData.workerCount`, frozen at spawn — it never reads the global; on the main thread it
answers `isMainWorker ? 1 : undefined`. The global's one and only reader is `restartWorkers`' default
`maxWorkersDown = Math.max(Math.floor(workerCount / 8), 1)`, so it is the _serving topology_ the
rolling-restart throttle is sized from, nothing more.

That makes the global writable only by a start that declares the topology. It used to be assigned
unconditionally from `options.threadCount` inside the `workerData` literal, so every job worker — which
passes no `threadCount` — set it to `undefined`, and the next rolling restart computed `NaN` (harper#2491).
`NaN` defeats the guard below it (`NaN < 1` is false) _and_ every throttle comparison, so the restart
took the whole pool down at once. A string does the same thing for the same reason. So the fix is the conditional write plus a consumer guard that clamps anything not a usable number. `Infinity` is exempt: it is the deliberate "all at once" sentinel `shutdownWorkers` passes, and `shutdownWorkersNow` depends on it to mark every worker synchronously before the first await. A literal `0` is also left alone, because it reads as a ratio rather than as garbage — it still reaches the ratio branch and stops the restart after one worker (harper#2601).

`workerData.workerCount` must stay exactly what it is for each start, `undefined` for job workers
included: an earlier attempt to give job workers the serving count instead broke the Windows
integration shard with ECONNREFUSED across the job tests. A job worker that believes it is part of the
pool behaves differently.

## A WebSocket close reason must be bounded to 123 bytes (`server/serverHelpers/webSocketCloseReason.ts`)

`ws` throws a `RangeError` when a close reason exceeds 123 bytes — the control-frame payload minus the
status code — and every close site Harper has reaches it from a rejection handler, where that throw
surfaces as an unhandled rejection rather than a failed close. Two of the reasons are outside Harper's
control: a `server.getUser` override's rejection text, and `request.pathname` in REST's no-resource
close. So every `ws.close()` carrying a dynamic reason goes through `toCloseReason()`, which truncates
on a code-point boundary (harper#2703).

The `ClassName: message` in a close reason is deliberate and not something to sanitize: the class name is
Harper's error code, and `errorToString` is the correct renderer for client-visible error text — see
AGENTS.md, "An error's class name is its error code". Only an internal fault's _message_ is replaced, by
`AUTHENTICATION_ERROR_MSGS.GENERIC_AUTH_FAIL`. The three terminal HTTP handlers (Node and Bun in
`server/http.ts`, uWS in `server/serverHelpers/uwsServer.ts`) must agree on that rendering; uWS rendered
the bare message until harper#2703, so the same error carried an error code on two runtimes and not the third.

REST settles a credential rejection _before_ its route lookup, so a rejected client gets the unauthorized
close rather than `1011 No resource was found` — which would otherwise disclose whether the resource exists.

## `serverErrorHandler` skips what `handlePostRequest` already logged (`server/serverHelpers/serverHandlers.js`)

`handlePostRequest` logs every error it throws, at error level or the error's own higher `fatal`/`notify`, and records it against its request; `serverErrorHandler`, which Fastify calls next with the same request, skips that error. Keep the log in `handlePostRequest` rather than moving it to the handler: `serverErrorHandler` logs an error with no `logLevel` of its own at info, below the default `warn`, so most operation errors would disappear from a default log; and a custom-function route that catches `hdbCore.request()`'s rejection never reaches the handler at all. The record is keyed by request, not by error, so an error object that surfaces again in another request is still logged there.

So a failure raised before the operation runs — a refusal from `chooseOperation`, a rejected request body — gets one Error line (a refusal also writes `chooseOperation`'s own `403 from operation …` and `User '…' is not permitted to …` lines; the Error line is the one that says why). An error the operation throws while it runs does not: `callOperationFunctionAsAwait` (`utility/OperationFunctionCaller.ts`) logs it, after an `Error calling operation: <handler>` line, and rethrows, and `handlePostRequest` logs it again. Its log is the only one for the callers that do not log — `server.operation()` from a component, the MCP operations tool, the SSE branch of `handlePostRequest` — so giving execution errors a single owner means deciding it for each of those, not dropping one log.

## A request-queue shed is a 503 the server never logged (`server/throttle.ts`)

`throttle()` sheds a queued call once `queuedCalls.length × averageEventCycleTime` exceeds the limit (20s
by default). `server/http.ts` answers it directly with `Service unavailable, exceeded request queue limit`
and records only an analytics action; nothing is thrown, so the HTTP error path that logs every thrown
status (`info` for a 503, `warn` for a 500) never runs, and the `DatabaseTransaction` write-queue and
conflict 503s log at `error` (once per stuck commit, rate-limited) as well as `info` when thrown. A 503
with that exact body is therefore the throttle, which now writes a rate-limited `warn` per throttle instance naming
the queue; `resources/Table.ts`'s cache-resolution throttle throws its own 503 under the same warn. The
gate is per instance on purpose: a shared one let a cache-fill shed silence the HTTP shed that followed.
Reproduce with a large concurrent non-GET burst on one CPU-starved worker
(`integrationTests/resources/sourcedfrom-eav-cache-coherence.test.ts` P1 under Bun pinned to a contended
core).

## Response compression dispatches on the serialized output, with one brotli policy (`server/serverHelpers/contentTypes.ts`)

With `http.compressionThreshold` non-zero (the shipped default is 0, off) and `Accept-Encoding: br`, `serialize()` compresses. It chooses between `serialize` and `serializeStream` by the _input_ (iterable or not), but it chooses how to compress by what the serializer _returned_: a `serializeStream` handler may return a complete body (the built-in msgpack handler returns `pack(data)` for a plain array; third-party `server.contentTypes` handlers may return strings or generators). A string or byte body takes the single-buffer path, where the threshold applies; a Readable is compressed as-is; any other iterable is adapted with `Readable.from`, as `http.ts` does for uncompressed iterable bodies. Piping a non-stream failed the request (#2421).

The compressor is attached with `stream.pipeline`, not `.pipe()`: `.pipe()` does not forward a source error, so a source failing mid-stream left the compressor open and the response hanging. With `pipeline` the failure destroys the compressor, which the transport reports and closes abruptly (next section).

Both compressor call sites take their parameters from `brotliOptions(contentType)`. Node's brotli default is quality 11, which compresses at about 1–2 MB/s — seconds of libuv-pool CPU for a multi-megabyte response — while quality 2 runs at 400–600 MB/s for a third to a half more bytes than 11 on JSON. A second call site with its own parameters is how the single-buffer path came to run at quality 11 while the stream path ran at 2; keep one definition. The operations API's Fastify compression (`operationsServer.ts`) is configured separately.

## A streamed response is completed only when its source ends cleanly (`server/http.ts`, `server/serverHelpers/uwsServer.ts`)

A response stream that fails after its first byte has no status left to report the failure with. The only signal HTTP/1.1 has is an incomplete message: the connection closes without the chunked terminator. So each transport sink ends the response for a source `'end'` and aborts the connection for anything else — a source `'error'`, or a `'close'` with no `'end'`. Ending cleanly instead hands the client a truncated body framed as a complete 200; formats that truncate at a record boundary (CSV, NDJSON, a msgpack sequence) then parse as a valid shorter result.

Node gets this from `stream.pipeline` in `pipeBodyToResponse`. uWS has no Writable to pipe into, so `streamResponse` wires the events itself and calls `res.close()`, which also runs `onAborted` and aborts the request signal. It also checks `source.destroyed`: the uWS handler resolves asynchronously, so a source can be destroyed, and its `'close'` already emitted, before the sink listens for it — the response would stay open forever. The `'error'` listener goes on before that check, because `destroy(error)` emits on a later tick and an `'error'` with no listener is thrown. Under Bun the main port is a `node:http` server and takes the `pipeBodyToResponse` path; the `Bun.serve` fetch handler buffers a stream body before it responds, so a failed source there is an ordinary error response.

This is the transport's fallback, not the error contract. SSE and NDJSON GETs hold their first step so an immediate failure is still an HTTP status, and they report later failures in-band ([Streaming startup errors](#streaming-startup-errors)). Every other format commits when the handler returns the stream, so a failure before its first chunk aborts the connection too. Pinned by `unitTests/server/serverHelpers/uwsServer.test.js` ("a response stream that does not end cleanly") and, end to end on every runtime leg, by `integrationTests/server/response-compression.test.ts`.

## A coarse uWS 413 drains a closing upload before ending the response

uWS force-closes a completed `Connection: close` response while an upload is still arriving, which can lose its status to EPIPE. `uwsServer.ts` flushes a non-empty coarse-limit 413 chunk before discarding bytes until body end or a one-second deadline; that absolute resource bound guarantees early status, not complete framing for a sender that ignores it. Destroying a paused Readable does not clear its queue, so teardown removes data listeners and reads out queued bytes in bounded chunks before retaining the response. Native abort disarms the finisher independently of handler cancellation. "uWS oversized TCP uploads" in `unitTests/server/serverHelpers/uwsServer.test.js` pins these paths and unchanged immediate keep-alive rejection. Other rejection sites, including downstream responses from `contentTypes.ts`'s default 10 MB limit, still end immediately and remain outside this coarse-cap correction.
